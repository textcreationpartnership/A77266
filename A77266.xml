            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It was an excellent Obſervation of an eminent Stateſ-man, then whom none more exquiſite in the diſcovery or ſurvey of the qualities, natures, and temperatures of Nations; <hi>That nothing is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, then to be familiarly and intimately verſed with the humors, garbs and conditions of ſuch people, with whom we are by interchange of Commerce (the ſtaple of every active and flouriſhing State) to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate.</hi> Of what high conſequence then may this Relation appear, having to life ſo exactly portray'd the Laws, Natures, and Qualities, <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>amorous,</hi> with the diſtinct tempers of neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nations, with which we have continued for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſo free and frequent Commerce, ſo familiar

The Divine powers, under which I ſtand or fall, have cloathed me with that spirit of reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, as it can encounter with the ſiniſtreſt and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt occurrents: and ſmile with a ſerene eye upon the unprosperouſeſt Overtures. I have oftimes look'd in the face of death for the preſervation of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys honour: and with a reſolute zeal grappled with the apparentſt Objects of danger. Then were there times, when by the proweſs of my Souldery, whoſe spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were armed for the higheſt aſſayes: and whoſe cordiall affections were ſo eſpouſed to me: as from the higheſt to the loweſt there was none in all my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, were he private Souldier or Commander, but he would expoſe his life to the utmoſt of danger, to ſecure me. Then, I ſay, had my deſires opportunity enough to work upon; and to accompliſh their ends: if I had entertain'd any ſuch ambitious thirſt of aspiring to a Crown: or of abuſing my Miſtreſs confidence, (whoſe advancement, both in title of Honour and Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it ſhall be my endeavour with much alacrity and loyall fervour conſtantly to promote.) No; ye noble and ever endeered Citizens, of whoſe affections I have hitherto amply pertakt: and whoſe numerous respects I ſhall no leſs readily then really ſtudy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite: my loyally-dispoſed breſt became never yet fired with any ſuch irregular heat: <hi>Licinio</hi> was the ſole Object of my revenge: who under pretence of a prudent and diſcreet management of our State;

            <p>This Speech, though delivered by a gallant ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and a Rhetoricall tongue (being no leſſe <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiall</hi> then <hi>Martiall</hi>) was not ſo well reliſhed as he expected. So full of levity and inconſtancy is vulgar favour; being not back'd nor ſeconded by ſager nor ſtronger heads then a confus'd Rable, or diſordered Multitude can any way afford: as may
<pb facs="tcp:170382:11"/> appear by the ſequele. For he found his ſpeech to be an inconſiderable breath, no ſooner uttered then ſleighted.</p>
            <p>For their Mechanick ſpirits quickly cooled and recoiled. Friendleſs <hi>Clarentio;</hi> then whom none more nobly endowed, nor conſtantly reſolved, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome ſmall reſiſtance of the City-Guards, which came thick upon him; finding his uſeleſs valour, and the declining ſtrength of his affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate aſſiſtants <hi>Lycorus</hi> and <hi>Merannes</hi> to fall off ſtill to their great diſadvantage: he was adviſed to give way to neceſſitie: and to apply to ſo deſperate a ſore, a relenting remedy. A remedy, I confeſs, which his brave ſpirit would not eaſily incline to: for nothing held a greater diſtance with his heroick thoughts then laying down his Arms by ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; albeit he could not viſibly apprehend any other refuge for ſafety to his own perſon or his weak ſupplies. Attached he muſt be and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted too of High Treaſon: For under that noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Licinio,</hi> his mortal Enemie ſtiled it: and highly aggravated it: that he might more indelebly lay an aſperſion upon his untainted honour: and beget him a laſting <hi>Odium</hi> with his Princeſs, which was his ſummary Labour. Some few dayes after (for the cruell ſubtilty of <hi>Licinio,</hi> would admit no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay) a Council of State was convened, wherein <hi>Clarentio</hi> with his Adhaerents were brought to a Judiciall Tryal. In which tryal the Priſoners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to Bar, might be diſplayed by their diſcovery of ſeveral paſſions or affections. For <hi>Clarentio,</hi> as one commiſerating the ſad condition of thoſe Gentlemen, whom their endeered love
<pb facs="tcp:170382:11"/> and perſonal affection to him and his concerns, had drawn into this action, was obſerv'd to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>praying:</hi> in relation to their ſecurity, more then his own ſafety. <hi>Lycorus,</hi> whoſe thoughts were not conſcious of the leaſt tincture of treaſon, as he conceived, at the time of his tryal, <hi>played.</hi> But <hi>Merannes,</hi> whither it was out of puſillanimity or too deep a reſentment of his miſery, I know not: but too much effeminate paſſion was he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to diſcover, by ſuch as ſtood near the Bar, all the time while his Evidence was in reading: for he <hi>wept;</hi> which detracted much from a ſpirit ſuppoſed to be ſpritely and reſolute. <hi>Magirides</hi> and <hi>Pernio</hi> being Delegats for this tryal: as they were Intimates to <hi>Licinio,</hi> left nothing unſaid or undone, that might any way aggravate their Crime: or exaſperate the Jurors, on whoſe verdict their lives depended, againſt them. In fine, they were all found guilty: which Sentence <hi>Magirides</hi> was pleaſed in a Rhetorical way (an improper Scheme of Elocution upon ſo Tragical an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to dilate on in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My Lords, you hear the qualitie of your Crimes, whereof you are all found guiltie: yet in my opinion, they admit a main and conſequent difference.

            <p>Upon his high and rigid aggravation of theſe in this manner, <hi>Clarentio</hi> in a compoſed and civile ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs being ready to make a reply: He was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted:

Neither do I impute this to the levity of my Prince: of whoſe gracious favours I have ſo amply partak't: but the ingratitude of time, and the mortall Enmity of my Oppoſers: who with one unite conſent pitch upon this reſult; to ground their riſing upon my ruine. And ſo far be my thoughts diſtanced from envying their imaginary happineſſe: or maligning their ſurreptitious greatneſſe: that I here proteſt before you all, Gentlemen, and atteſt Heav'n to record it: that I freely and cordially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thoſe numerous and inſupportable indignities they have done me: not onely in deſigning my death: for that is the lowest in the skale of my ſufferings: and the leaſt in my dimenſion: but in their traducing of my fame: and blemiſhing mine honour, which might deſcend (if the Charity of good men ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it) in after-ages to my poſterity. Theſe, I ſay, in this my laſt accompt to Nature, I really pardon: wiſhing, they may receive the like entertaine in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as I render them now cancell'd in this my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Earth. Now to confirm your opinion of my innocency, I beſeech you lend me your attention with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170382:15"/> a firme confidence of what I deliver to be authentick truth. The words of dying men ſhould enforce the deepeſt impreſſion, and receive moſt credit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I here vow before him that made me: and before whom I am to ſtand or fall: that this breaſt never foſter'd ſuch a thought, as might tend to Treaſon: or any ſeditious project againſt my Prince or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of her State. I was ever more retentive of thoſe Graces and Priviledges of Honour I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; then to blaunch them with an Act of ſuch palpable ingratitude. It is not unknown to moſt of you, my Noble Lords, how perſonall Enmity and ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests were the activeſt inſtruments of my fall. If they were here in preſence, whom I onely glance at: for my time, as it is ſhort, ſo moſt improper for vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of wrongs, or impeaching of perſons; They could not with modeſty deny, with what instancy they have ſollicited my compliance: and with what plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive pretences they labourd to traine me to their Lure. Which I could never in honour acquieſce to: finding their aimes to be mercenary: and grounded on indirect Principles: yet this, to this houre I never diſcovered; ſo tender I was of preſerving their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes; who now make my Paſſage hence, their moſt Comicall and delightfull paſtime.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſhall requeſt one ſuit more of you my Lords; but eſpecially of you, my L.</hi> Stratonico; <hi>being moſt verſ'd in the Court: and moſt frequently in the eye of my Prince; that you would vouchſafe me that honour, as to preſent the moſt humble and devotionall Obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of a dying Servant to her Majeſty. Whoſe laſt votive Sacrifice unto God, ſhall be for her long, happy and prosperous Continuance in this her flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170382:16"/> State and Imperiall Command of</hi> Candy. <hi>And to ſupport this ſo glorious a Fabrick of State, may ſhe have a grave and conſcientious Counſell to adviſe her in the mannage and government of her affaires. And that her prudentiall Senate may be ever purged of thoſe ulcerous members, whoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthum'd condition might corrupt the Conſtitution of her State.— Now good night to all the world: — Executioner performe thy Office. My peace is made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Executioner, more ſenſible it ſeem'd of <hi>Clarentio's</hi> ſuffering, then he was of his own; holding it an ungratefull Act to take off his head, who had formerly ſav'd his life; became ſurpriz'd with ſuch a Panick fear; as his trembling hand, knew not how to direct the Axe. Which <hi>Clarentio</hi> obſerving, incouraged him to do his work; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>Be not ſo diſcourteous to me, <hi>Funello,</hi> for the favour I once ſhew'd thee; as to delay the expected minute of my remove: Truſt me, I ſuffer more in thy protraction, then I ſhall in the performance of thine office.</q> But theſe words did but lightly allay his feares; which appeared at the very inſtant of this Execution. For ſuch a trembling paralyticall motion indiſpoſed his hand, as his Axe miſſing the joynt at which he aimed wounded him twice or thrice, terribly in his ſhoulder; before he took off his head: which was preſently put into a damaske bag: and his body, though privately; yet with much decencie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed and interred in a Vault anciently belonging to his Family.</p>
            <p>Many howers were not paſt, till the Relation of this Tragicall Action came to the eare of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170382:16"/> either from the hand of <hi>Stratonico;</hi> a Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of principall eſteeme: and to whom <hi>Clarentio</hi> had at his death made his addreſs for preſenting his humbleſt Service to her Majeſty: or from <hi>Athalia;</hi> who, as you forme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly heard, had either neglected or injuriouſly ſleighted that pious and amicable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of delivering thoſe lines and Ring to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed Princeſſe, which <hi>Clarentio</hi> had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to her care and charge.</p>
            <p>And by all probabilitie it came from <hi>Athalia,</hi> who having a deep reſentment of her unexpiable guilt: the very Evening after this Execution done; ſhe repaired to the Court: and going up to the Princeſse Bed-chamber; diſcovered with much paſſion what was befaln <hi>Clarentio:</hi> with her neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of that office which ſhe was obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. Wherewith the Princeſs, as one ſurpriz'd with fear of the iſſue, no leſs quickly then paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately interrupting her; what office might that be whereto you flood obliged, <hi>Athalia;</hi> and failed in your performance? In my not preſenting thoſe lines with a Ring incloſed to your Majeſtie. What lines? what Ring? and from whom? with tear-ſwoln eyes, and a weak-breathing accent, ſhe replied, from <hi>Clarentio.</hi> Oh then, have we loſt eternally, <hi>Clarentio!</hi> May Iliads of miſeries pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue thee, faithleſs <hi>Athalia.</hi> Be a ſtranger to our Court for ever; for ruining him; whoſe actions compleated him in every Charge that our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands impoſed on him, an abſolute Perſon of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. More would not her Princely paſſion either give way to hear; nor inquire: but retiring to her Cloſet, with a ſevere injunction of <hi>Athalias</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170382:17"/> from her Court: She remained as one exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciz'd for many daies after; admitting none to her preſence.</p>
            <p>Not long after this uncouth ſolitude and diſ-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſionate retirement, <hi>Stratonico</hi> was ſuffer'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her with the whole <hi>Series</hi> of this Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt <hi>Clarentio,</hi> and by whom he was with moſt vehemencie and rigour proſecuted; together with his free and ingenuous atteſtation upon the Scaffold, of his integrious thoughts during the whole carriage of his imploiments in his relations to loyaltie and conſtant fidelitie, which he would with all alacritie ſeal, (to clear his Familie of any ſuch tincture) with the Sacrifice of his blood. This Narration recruted her paſſion: and imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in her royal affections a ſtronger apprehenſion Of his vertues. But alas, within ſhort time this conceipt of his approved integritie: and his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited Cenſure ſo ſtrongly wrought upon her, as it brought her into a great indiſpoſition of health: but attempered nothing of her heat, in purſuing his revenge againſt thoſe active Inſtruments of his ruine. For <hi>Magirides,</hi> and <hi>Pernio,</hi> who were his Rhadamanthean Judges were ſhortly after degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and with Writts of Eaſe juſtly rewarded. And for <hi>Licinio</hi> the prime Actor in this Tragedy; had not a noiſome diſeaſe abridged his daies; an heavie and exemplarie Sentence of Proſcription had attached him.</p>
            <p>Now to Epitomize the Excellencies of this Princeſſe <hi>Bellingeria,</hi> it were eaſie to collect hence; the nobleneſs and puritie of her diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in reteining the memorie of ſuch as had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170382:17"/> their Endevours in the Carriage of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires with fidelitie: and her care to vindicate their honours, whom irregular Command or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of Proceeding, to the prejudice of her Court, had illegally cenſured. Favorites ſhe would admit none, ſave ſuch as favoured vertue. For Councellours of State; ſhe made choice of none, but where Judgment and Conſcience were Concomitants. Humane Learning ſhe affected; as an Imbelliſhment to higher Studies. State-read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe made ſingular uſe of: and to times and occaſions prudently applied thoſe requiſites. Though unprovoked, ſhe appear'd of a benigne and peaceable nature, lyable to no feminine nor weak humour; yet if aſſaulted, or by any invaſive Force were it never ſo formidable diſguſted; She would appeare a Princely Martialiſt: and in time of danger, give ample teſtimonies of her incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vallour: for ſhe would not ſtick to go before her Souldiers with her Leading Staffe in her hand: and play the General in the Field, to incourage her men by her example to fight.</p>
            <p>So accompliſh'd was <hi>Bellingeria;</hi> and of ſuch Princely endowments, being no leſſe formidable to her Enemies; then infinitely winning and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate to her own: as ſhe might appeale to the whole progreſſe of her flouriſhing Government, if ever any State were managed with more Forraigne feare and Domeſtick love. A preſident to preſent times: and memoriall to future Ages. Yet the pureſt Cloath may admit it's ſtaine: and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griouſeſt perſon incurr a blemiſh.</p>
            <p>This I might inſtance in this unparallel'd Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170382:18"/> a Lady memorable for her virile and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine valour; and no leſs generally fam'd for her virgin honour. Whoſe royall repute receiv'd a deep taint or tincture in one action; which, to contract our ſtory with more brevity, cloſed thus.</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Mariana,</hi> a Lady for ſtate and magnifiſcence, a <hi>Sophonisba;</hi> for bounty and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence a <hi>Berenice;</hi> who was nearly linkt in blood to <hi>Berengeria.</hi> She, for diverſe occurrences thwartly incountring her, was adviſed to leave her Country, where ſhe had ſo many powerfull Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and to retire to the Confines of <hi>Candy;</hi> where ſhe might be confident of a free and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Hoſpitality; with all ſuch princely accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations as might hold correſpondence with a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of her quality. With theſe faire and plauſive promiſes was <hi>Mariana</hi> induced to decline her Countrey: and repaire to <hi>Candy.</hi> Where ſhe had not long ſojourned; till ſome unworthy Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of State, pretending a zeal to the Princeſſe; ſuggeſted to her too credulous ſpirit; what am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious thoughts <hi>Mariana</hi> had of uſurping a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty: and how her recourſe to <hi>Candy,</hi> although it pretended perſonall ſafety: was to ingratiate the eminentſt Peers to ſecond her in the purſuit of her regall Title; in ſucceſſion to the Kingdom; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhe held her ſelf neareſt by a lineall and heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary deſcent, to the Crown.</p>
            <p>This private ſuggeſtion infinitely perplext the Princeſſe; neither would ſhe at firſt give eare unto it: interpreting all things, according to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her nature, to the beſt ſence. But at laſt by long perſwaſion, and ſundry arguments of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170382:18"/> to induce her belief; ſhe became doubtfull of <hi>Mariana's</hi> fidelity. And within few daies after, injoyned her a reſtraint: and that ſo eaſie, as it abridg'd not much her Liberty. But this jealouſie, fomented by ſome officious Agents, became daily increaſed; and by degrees to ſuch height, as ſhe became attached of High Treaſon (which to cleare the Princeſſe innocence, ſhe was wholly unknown to.) The Malignants of this diſtreſſed Lady, were main and many. And to expedite their deſigne, ſhe became ſoon impeached. Artiſts they could not want to execute their work. At <hi>Famorgned</hi> was a Stately Scaffold ſhortly erected, where this unfortunate Lady was to ſacrifice her life. Where ſhe appeared with a cheerfull and amicable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: (as what will not innocence cloathed with a noble ſpirit perſonate) and calling upon her Gentlewomen <hi>Philanthe;</hi> wiſhed her not to be at all amated with her death: <q>though it be a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſaid ſhe, that I neither expected nor meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. My innocence incourageth me, and bids me boldly look death in the face.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After ſhe had taken a turn or two over the Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; and eying the Exetutioner: <q>I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſaid ſhe, that thou art more fearfull of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting thy Office, then I ſhall be in ſuffering the ſtroak of Juſtice. But it behoves me to ſpeak ſomething in my own defence: though I could not be admitted to that favour at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> time of my judgment.</q> Then inclining her body with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick grace (as no Perſon could put on Majeſtie with a more becoming or unaffected poſture) ſhe delivered herſelf in theſe words.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:170382:19"/>
            <p>
               <q>Gentlemen, and you that are Perſons of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; be pleaſed to hear the laſt words of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Stranger; One, the innocencie of whoſe actions never deſerved any ſuch cenſure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I came here for Sanctuarie; and behold the fruits of <hi>Candies</hi> hoſpitalitie! I came here for ſafetie; and the Sacrifice of my life aſſures me of Securitie. To tell you what I am, I ſhall not need much to acquaint you: few of you ſpheared in the rank of Nobilitie, but are known to my deſcent; I leave it to the puritie of my Soul to atteſt my deſert. But the Cauſe is ſoon pleaded, where no Advocate will be admitted. Before I came forth of my own Countrey, I heard great fame of your Princeſs goodneſs: and <hi>Candies</hi> benignitie. My Entrance was no Deſign of diſloyaltie, but an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of apparent neceſſitie; hoping to find that entertain abroad, which I could not partake of at home. I cannot but acknowledge my lineal right, but to reach at a Crown before it fell due: or to uſurpe a Command from an others intereſt, was the leaſt of my thoughts, the loweſt of my ſcorn. To my knowledge, my demean has not merited any of theſe high indignities from any of your Peerage. My life has been hitherto of more retirement, then to imbroile my Perſon in any forraign affairs, or to fiſh in troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t to what end do I diſcourſe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt Condition of my life, drawing ſo near a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My Lords, I know there be ſome of you, who out of a native compaſſion (the expreſs Character
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170382:19"/> of a noble nature) will commiſerate my fall: and retein an harſh conceipt of thoſe that were ſuch eager hunters after my bloud. To you I appeal as vindicators of mine honour; which upon the word of a diſtreſſed Princeſs, you may ſafely act without the leaſt blemiſh to your unqueſtion'd repute. It was the Clandeſtine practiſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie of my Enemies, who deſigned my ruine, that winged my courſe for <hi>Candy.</hi> And by ſome eminent perſons, as their aſſurance by Letters will manifeſt; I was made to believe (ſo apt was my innocence to become credulous) that nothing could be wanting, that might ſuit with a perſon of my qualitie in the Puncto of Honour, or any proper accommodation correſponding to ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable a Stranger. But my too late experience taxeth now my indiſcreet Credulitie. It had been much better for me to have periſhed in my own Confines with honour: then to die in another, and remain branded with an ignominious Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But we muſt not conteſt with Fate: nor condemn Heaven of Injuſtice. Fit it is that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Powers ſhould exerciſe their dominion over Inferiour Bodies. Such high Decretals ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no Prohibitions. But I aſſume too much pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge upon your patience: this unneceſſarie ſpinning out of time, may ſome argue, implies a puſillanimitie of ſpirit: which, thanks to my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, ſtands at great diſtance with the reſolution of my temper. We have hitherto, for the moſt part of our time, ſailed on a rough and turbulent Ocean: and arriving now near our Harbour, what ſhould we fear? Farewell to all; with a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170382:20"/> free remitment to thoſe who purſued me to death. Then calling upon <hi>Philanthe;</hi> who all this while appeared like another <hi>Niobe,</hi> drenched in tears. Lend me thine hand, ſaid ſhe, <hi>Philanthe:</hi> and pay thy laſt dutie to thy dying Ladie.</q> Where laying her Head, (above a feminine compoſure) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Block; with a princely majeſtie elevating her Eyes to heaven, where no doubt, her thoughts and fervorous deſires were already fixed, ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoed with incomparable patience, and ſoveraigntie over her paſſions, the ſtroake of death.</p>
            <p>This immerited Action lay a fowle aſperſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Bellingeria:</hi> taxing her both for her too light credulitie; and too much crueltie.</p>
            <p>Firſt of Credulitie; in opening her boſom to ſuch groundleſs reports as the malignancie of her Foes had merely ſuggeſted. Secondly, of Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; in embruing her imperial hand in her Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans bloud; who fled to her Court for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour: and not to be proceeded withall, as a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. Hence it was, that ſome of her neareſt, and thoſe of the pureſt and cleareſt Judgment ſpar'd not to ſay; That it was an apparent breach of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional amitie: and a flat violation of Hoſpitalitie; which might be by theſe Evidences clearly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted.</p>
            <p>For, in the firſt place, there had been a firme Juncto and conſtant correſpondence, confirmed by mutual preſents and arguments of affection, cemented more ſtrongly by the tie of Conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; betwixt theſe two Royal Ladies.

            <p>Yet in the diſcoverie of all theſe heavy paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, trenching ſo highly upon <hi>Bellingeria's</hi> honor; if we ſhould take an impartial ſurvey of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars tending to her vindication; we ſhall find ſundry effectual motives, and thoſe ſtrongly endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing us to entertain a clearer conſtruction of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingeria</hi>'s proceeding againſt <hi>Mariana.</hi> True it is, indeed, that upon ſome perſwaſive ſuggeſtions, hammered by Perſons nearly intereſted to the State; the Princeſs gave way to her Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which might be taken rather for an eaſie confinement, then any ſtrict reſtraint. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Judgment pronounced; or the Act of Juſtice executed, ſhe was wholly ignorant: as might appear by ſundrie pregnant circumſtances: which might be collected hence. Firſt, this Princeſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch time as ſhe had received certain adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of the weight and rigour of thoſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings againſt her injured Kinſwoman; ſhe could never endure to admit any of her Proſecutors to her preſence: diſplacing ſuch as were Gown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and perſons of Judicature: and eſtranging thoſe Favorites from her Court, who had any hand in the haſtning of her diſpatch. Nay, in her Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Progreſs, it was ever obſerved; when at any time her Jeſts lay near that Place where <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi> ſuffered; in reſentment of her death, ſhe would uſually take her Evening Proceſſion, one of her Ladies onely attending her, to the place of her Interment: where ſhe would ſolemnize her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with pious tears: cauſing a fair Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ebony to be erected, and with an elegant Inſcription beautified. Though by her next Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170382:21"/> her body became afterwards removed, and with much ſolemnitie tranſlated, to a Fane or Temple of more honour: where it now remains regiſtred among the Eminenſt Princes of <hi>Candy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have we, and no leſſe then deſervingly, with an eaſie Sponge wip'd off thoſe aſperſions which licentious Calumny ariſing from the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of time, had thrown upon the ſame of this unparallel'd Lady.

            <p>But we are now to deſcend from the deſcription of this abſolute Idea of all Princes in her time; to her farewell on earth. You are now to imagin this Orient Sun, after ſhe had attained to a ripe and full age, being already got to her Climactericall yeare inveloped in a Cloud, that fable Shroud of mortality.</p>
            <p>Albeit, it was generally thought, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of her body conſidered: and her excellent temper in her directions of diet obſerved; She might, to the joy of her Subjects, have lived much longer: had not ſome occurrents violently incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring with her paſſions, enfeebled her health and contracted the Courſe of Nature. Neither was this paſſionate Conflict diſcovered in any perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Object more, then in the loſſe of her <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio:</hi> which name with an aſſiduate Tribute of teares, all along during the time of her Sickneſs, ſhe uſually repeated and reiterated: ſuch deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of affection had the Opinion of his Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170382:22"/> Service imprinted in her heart. But forc'd at laſt to yield to Nature; ſhe ſeem'd infinitely to rejoyce in her Remove, thanking Fate with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſmile, for winning her addreſſe to ſo faithfull a Friend: and ſerviceable an Inſtrument of State. But ſome there were who imputed theſe ravings and diſtempers to the extremity of her Sickneſs: which we ſhall not here diſpute. It appeared that her memory continued perfect to her death: for ſhe gave expreſs Commands ſome daies before, that <hi>Lycorus</hi> and <hi>Merannes</hi> with all thoſe that adheared to <hi>Clarentio's</hi> faction ſhould be inlarged and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their Eſtates.</p>
            <p>After ſuch time as <hi>Bellingeria's</hi> Funeralls had been with all Princely magnificence ſolemnized. <hi>Candy</hi> became infinitely diſtracted, touching the Nomination of their next Prince. For though they were ſatisfied in relation to his deſcent: being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable Heire to the deceaſed Princeſs: yet bore they a great diſguſt to the <hi>Nation</hi> from whence he was to come: being <hi>Illiria;</hi> a People naturally ſervile, uncivile and puſillanimous. Neither could it be ſuppos'd as moſt men thought, that the <hi>Illirian</hi> could challenge his own without great oppoſition: or enjoy his Crown without much effuſion of blood: and that ſome Electorate Eſtate would be ſpeedily conſtituted to croſs the <hi>Illirian</hi> deſcent. Which fared much otherwiſe; for <hi>Cicelio,</hi> a grave, ſerious and prudent perſon; though naturally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from Martiall affaires, had ſo ingratiated the Peeres and principall Members of State (as what will not Gifts effect?) as he entred the Iſle with generall approvement and acclamation. None to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170382:22"/> oppoſe him: all with alacrious ſpirits ready to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him: and to prepare away tahis Coronation; which within few dayes after was accompliſhed: and with ſuch Solemnity as it drove the <hi>Illirian</hi> Prince, now <hi>Candies</hi> Soveraign, into an high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement. Juſts, Tilts and Turnaments; Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Enterludes, Masks, and Pagentry of all ſorts, preſented with incomparable ſtate and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite coſt by the Citizens of <hi>Thamiſopolis;</hi> where theſe Coronation Shows were contrived, prepared &amp; perfected. Ceſterns ran abundantly with Claret, White and Rheniſh, as if they had ſprung from the <hi>Celtick</hi> rivolets. Neither could this high preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of State beget leſs then amazement in the <hi>Illirian</hi> Prince; ſeeing his own indigent, rude and illiterate Nation, never entertain'd his Eyes with any ſuch rarities. His royal Conſort, a Princeſs of a gallant compoſure and ſtately deportment, was with the choiceſt voices and airs, wherewith ſhe was infinitely delighted, after the compleating of theſe Solemnities, gracefully receaved. Where the Lady <hi>Honetta</hi> and <hi>Devoneſſa</hi> by their incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable voices and accompliſh'd demean wrought ſo ſtrongly upon her affection: as no ſociety, treat, Ball nor Preſentment could appear grateful to this Princeſs without their preſence. And in very deed the free and frolick humors of theſe two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſuited nearly with the Princeſs diſpoſition. For her Husband, being naturally addicted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement: or ſuch Contemplative ſtudies as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliſhed much her palat; being a Lady dedicated to pleaſure, by his privacy gave her way to all Courtly Liberty. Great was her content in Masks
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170382:23"/> and Revels: wherein, if ſhe chanced to obſerve any perſon more gracefully eminent, or actively performing then the reſt; to do him the honour and compleat the preſentment in a more abſolute manner, ſhe would with much cheerfulneſs and princely alacrity joyn with him in the Meaſure: and teſtifie her grateful acceptance with an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate favour.</p>
            <p>This begot in her young Court-Damaſella's an infinite affection:<note place="margin">An Idea or Modell of a New Court.</note> joying much in the change of their condition: For <hi>Bellingeria</hi> in her raign could not enjoyn the Attendants of her Court more regular reſtraint, then this Princeſs after her ſhort reſide in the Court, initiated them in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of liberty. State-affairs were not ſo much as thought on. New-faſhion'd habits, melodious aires, amorous parlies, with a Mintage of quaint deviſed complements, ſuch as the ruſtick incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the <hi>Illirian</hi> Nation had never made their Princes acquainted withall.</p>
            <p>All this time, <hi>Honetta</hi> and <hi>Dioneſſa,</hi> Ladies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedicated to pleaſure, and who had formerly to too much freedom expoſed their honour, ceaſed not to preſent objects of Fancy to their frolick Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigneſs; Which could not be ſo privately ſuggeſted, but it was in the Ear of the Court cloſely diſperſed. Which her ſlow and ſupine Prince either never heard of, or took no notice of: having the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not ſo much as to unlock the well-ordered Cabinet of his heart to any thought of Jealouſie. For the activeneſs of his Spirit was wholly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Field-pleaſures: and ſuch Sociable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, as reliſhed more the palat; then any other
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170382:23"/> youthful or amorous addreſs. Which thoſe two wanton voluptuous Ladies nimbly and artfully wrought upon in their application to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort.</p>
            <p>One Evening in a free Career of Diſcourſe (in a cloſe Arbour delightfully impaled with Myrtles, Emblems to a love-parley) <hi>Honetta</hi> an Excellent Tutoreſſe in loves Principles, told her Princeſſe, how in her Survey of a Court life, wherein ſhe had been vers'd from her Infancy, ſhe found nothing more conſentaneous to a free and inlarged ſpirit then a rational and correſponding Favorite, to whom any Lady with reſervancy to her honour, might impart the ſecreſie of her affection: and receive aſſiſtance in the fair purſuit of her Deſires.</p>
            <p>What might theſe <hi>Favorites</hi> be, anſwer'd the Princeſs, on whom, my dear <hi>Honetta,</hi> you are pleaſed to beſtow ſo fair a title, and ſo clear a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter? Madam, quoth ſhe, my Expreſſes ſhall be ſhort and real. Though <hi>Plato</hi> be dead, his <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks</hi> ſurvive. We have many here of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Sect, that will labour by their fair deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to merit your acceptance: who be thoſe, ſaid the Princeſs, whom amongſt thy Select ones, may receive ſo free admittance to our relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? None of all our Courtiers, anſwer'd <hi>Honetta,</hi> more correſponding then <hi>Lycorus,</hi> (a perſon formerly ingaged in an action of infinite conſequence and probable peril.) <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voneſſa</hi> hearing the name of <hi>Lycorus</hi> commended to the Princeſs for her <hi>Platonick;</hi> was not a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliſhed with <hi>Honettas</hi> choice; being a perſon whom ſhe had formerly entertain'd in her boſom before
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170382:24"/> all others: and to whom with much intimacy ſhe had devoted her affection. O by no means, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, make <hi>Lycorus</hi> none of your <hi>Platonicks</hi> (replied <hi>Dioneſſa</hi>) he cannot poſſibly prove faithful in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of your ſecrets, who has profeſt himſelf a Servant to many Miſtreſſes. I could commend one to you, Madam, ſaid <hi>Devoneſſa,</hi> whoſe perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, as it might beget in you a merited accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſo the approvement of his ſecreſie, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may highly concern your honour, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly correſpond with your admittance. And this is <hi>Merannes;</hi> a Perſon of a Courtly garb and amiable preſence. This choice tendred to the Princeſs (by way of revenge, for otherwiſe it could not be conſtrued) did not a little nettle <hi>Honetta;</hi> for none more boſomly dear then <hi>Merannes</hi> nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly affectionate: though with a pleaſant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance ſhe wiſely cover'd it: as if her thoughts were wholly eſtranged from any ſuch Object. But <hi>Devoneſſa</hi> knew well, that <hi>Honetta</hi> could not but hold herſelf fully requited for her propoſal of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus</hi> to the Princeſs.</p>
            <p>Time thus run on rather in amorous diſcourſes and introductions to Love then any other actuall expreſſes. Wherein though the Princeſs <hi>Iſmenia</hi> ſhew'd her ſelf a <hi>Soveraigneſſe</hi> of <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> yet there appeared in her no diſcovery of any Select Favorite; ſo cautious ſhe was in her Choice: and ſo obſervant in the points of honour. Albeit ſome light Cenſors of the Court, who meaſur'd the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of others affections by their own ſcantling; and whoſe eyes were no leſs ſuſpicious, then tongues liberall; ſpread a report of her intimacy
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170382:24"/> with <hi>Lycorus;</hi> whoſe diſcreet compoſure was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known to tranſgreſs the limits of honour: nor ingage his repute to an inhibited pleaſure. But ſome ground there was (and weake is that ground which cenſorious jealouſie cannot build on) and it aroſe from hence: <hi>Baſilius,</hi> her retired Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, a Perſon wholly devoted to privacy and Comtemplative Studies, unleſs ſome other lighter Pleaſure for recreation-ſake, entertain'd him: walking one Evening in his Garden; and finding <hi>Lycorus</hi> in pleaſant private diſcourſe with his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: <hi>I approve this highly (ſaid</hi> Baſilius) <hi>I ſee we are all for Platonick Learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Speech, without ground, begot an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in thoſe light jealous Courtiers, but eſpecially the Ladies, who variouſly rendred thoſe words of <hi>Baſilius,</hi> and much different from his meaning: That this weak Prince more eſpouſed to Learning then Love; being conſcious of his own deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, had diſ-intereſſed himſelf of his Princeſs: and freely recommended her to the Tutelage of a Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick Lord. Which traduce no ſooner came to <hi>Iſmenias</hi> eare, whoſe innocent freedom might clearly vindicate it ſelf from any ſuch groundleſs imputation, ſhe could not be at reſt till ſhe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted this Charge of honour in this manner. The words are rendred according to their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall tenure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ladies, wherein has my freedom ſo highly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it ſhould nurſe in you this opinion? Cannot diſcourſe be entertain'd without lightneſs: nor the admittance of a Courtier without ſuſpicion of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe? I am as yet but a ſtranger in your Court:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170382:25"/> and I wiſh with all mine heart, that I had never been initiated in it, if it ſtand ſo affected. A diadem is a precious Ornament, but inferiour to fame. — This I had before I came among you: and injoy'd my dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with as much liberty, and more honour. Surely, I cannot think otherwiſe, but that there raigns much infection in that Court; where harmeleſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection appeares ſo infectious. I ſhould prove as cruell to each accent of my delivery, as the</hi> Oſtridge <hi>to her eggs, if they ſhould produce a diſcovery of lightneſs in their iſſue. I have heard from ſome of you Ladies, whoſe long diſcipline hath ſufficiently ſchool'd you in the mode and rarity of Courts, that Platonick ſociety might be admitted without the least touch or blemiſh of diſhonour. And muſt a Rule of Exception be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to a Princeſs which admits none to the freedom of her Ladies? Muſt our reſtraint inlarge your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty? How far better then is it to imbrace Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection then Severaignty? If the felicity of Princes conſist in dominion; why ſhould it not diſcover it ſelf moſt in priority of affection? Are we to be lower in our love, becauſe higher in our line?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ancient Records render us this teſtimony of our glorious Predeceſſor</hi> Athalia <hi>ſometimes Princeſs of</hi> Candy; <hi>that though her life was ſingle, expreſſing in it ſingular Continence: her Parts exquiſite, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd withall Princely Excellence; her exploits admirable, manifesting her proweſs and happineſs: yet did ſhe allow her ſelf</hi> State-favorites, <hi>to inable her in Rules of Politick Government, without the leaſt Sentiment of Lightneſs. Her life was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: and her death to the quality of her life corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent. Let me obtaine this boone of you, faire La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170382:25"/> that I may freely injoy without Cenſure, what my Progenitors did without leaſt diminution to their honour. But if this may not be admitted me, I will propoſe unto you Ladies a more regular Copy of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. Platonicks ſhall be to us ſtrangers: and our Needles our conſtant Conſorts. A ſtraid look ſhall incurre a Forfeiture. And for the</hi> Court, <hi>The Queens ſide ſhall become a Cloiſter; let my Liege uſe his at his pleaſure. This, I hope, will prevent all jealouſie: and free us from all ſcandalous reports and immerited infamy. For dye had we rather with Fame, then live in diſhonour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This drove ſuch a cold qualme into thoſe young Ladies hearts; as they knew not by what meanes to bring their injuried and highly incenſed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to her Former temper. The Court grew quite out a tune. A ſad and uncouth Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a ſtrange Gueſt to that Place, had ſabled eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Roome. The Queenes ſide appeared like a Tragicall Tyring houſe. But long did not theſe Sudds of Sorrow nor dumps of diſcontent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. That <hi>Italian</hi> Proverb confirmed it ſelf true in this Cataſtrophe. <hi>Short is Sorrows ſurfet, where Court-pleaſure makes her Palet.</hi> New Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments enlivened ſpritely and active affections. The Platonick State, ſo lately diſheartned by <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia's</hi> diſguſt, in a more refined and compt garbe begun to reſume its former beauty and liberty. Tilts and Turnaments with other Martiall Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wherein the Peerage were formerly imployed; became Addreſſes of too virile a quality.</p>
            <p>Carpet-Knights were not for Campe-Service: nor Court-Couches convertible to Field-Bedds.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170382:26"/> Schools and Academies of Love ſtored with choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Lectures of pure and attractive Rhetorick, to make their dialect a more powerfull Sollicitor to Fancy, were erected: and Maſters of Revells ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and amply endowed; and theſe were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in contriving and inventing variety of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick and Paſtorall delights: which were uſually preſented in their private Court Theaters, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly erected for ſuch Enterludes and Comicall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions. And good opportunity had <hi>Iſmenia</hi> with her amorous Ladies to play the Platonick Courtiers: ſeeing <hi>Baſilius</hi> made the Wild Forreſt the Place of his ſolace and recreation. VVhence ſome virulent Spirits would not ſtick to traduce <hi>Iſmenia:</hi> and make her honour ſuſpected: ſaying, that ſo long as <hi>Actaeon</hi> purſued his Chace: his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cione</hi> might ſecurley make choice of her Game. But thoſe who were known to her Conjugall Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (though too much freedom might blemiſh her Fame) might witneſs for her, that her Princely thoughts mounted above the ſpheare of ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile affections. Being ſuch an abſolute Empreſs of her deſires; as in thoſe Platonick Encounters; where the ſtrength of Continency was many times brought to a tryall: if her Pretending Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick tranſported too much with confidence ſhould divert from their addreſſed diſcourſe, were it morall, hiſtoricall or mixt: and aſſume to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a freedom leſs becoming: though more amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly glancing: ſhe would not forbear ſharpely to reprove him <hi>ſaying, that he had tranſgreſſed</hi> Plato's <hi>Laws: For ſome of his Works ſhe had read lately rendred in her own Native dialect: but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170382:26"/> found him act the part of a ſenſuall Suiter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Molidorus</hi> indeed, was holden her Eminent Favorite: and ever receiv'd, upon his appliance to her, with a gracefull Entertaine. But never more then modeſty might admit: For in private viſits, after that aſperſion thrown on her, upon her reported intimacy with <hi>Lycorus,</hi> no Courtier, were he never ſo accompliſh'd, could have acceſs or admittance to her, without the preſence of ſome of her Ladies of Honour. So as in this, ſo in other Objects of Fancy, her unblemiſh'd Fame was injuriouſly traduced. But her maſculine reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from a nobleneſs of Spirit, ſleighted all ſuch palpable aſperſions.</p>
            <p>Neither could the purity of her Fame be more really clear from Infamy, then <hi>Bazilius</hi> honeſt heart was of the leaſt thought of Jealouſy.</p>
            <p>Neither did this indifferency to Feminine Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, nor his affection to the contrary Sex, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed (as ſome weakly conceipted) from frigidity of Nature: nor any inordinate degeneracy: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the guſt of thoſe active recreations and exerciſes which he affected: and in their quality more ſuitable to men then women. But we are not here to weave Apologies. Hiſtorians with an integrious and impartial pen are to relate, but not to render an accompt of the actions of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, wherof they treat. Thoſe import their own intereſt: and as they acted upon the Stage; ſo muſt they receive their applauſe and approvement by the vogue and voice of their Spectators. In a word, as to ſooth Princes in their purſuit of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming liberty, is noxious: ſo too curiouſly to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170382:27"/> make inſpection into the ſecreſie of their actions, is very dangerous. <hi>Domitian</hi> could not endure a diſcovery of his delight in the purſuit of <hi>Flies.</hi> Such toyes are held ſerious imployments with trifling Commanders: who lay not the ground of their undertakings upon what beſeems them, but on what delights them.</p>
            <p>But let us return to our Court, bathed in all pleaſures that either the height of Fancy or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of State could contrive. Neither had <hi>Candy</hi> at that time, as you may collect by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel, much to imploy herſelf withall, ſave onely with ſumptuous Entertains, delicious Treats, and gorgeous Dreſs. For ſo happy was ſhe in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a peaceable Prince: as by bounteous gifts and other obliging waies, he had not onely made neighbouring Princes his Friends: but poſſeſt himſelf of that opinion of prudence and Princely policy: as no difference aroſe among them, which with unanimous conſent they would not refer to his deciſion. This graceful and long-continued habit of peace, as it enricht the State with plenty: ſo it begot in the Inhabitants an incommodious ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie. For thoſe virile &amp; maſculine ſpirits, which formerly proclaimed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Heirs of Honour, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come now ſtrangers to actions &amp; exploits of valor, being wholly unexercis'd to thoſe Martial affairs, wherewith their firſt Aſſaies of Youth had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured. Neither would thoſe Stoical Cenſors of the State who profeſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelvs mortal Antagoniſts to all Masks, Treats, Balls and reer-viſits, ſtick to enveigh againſt the ſenſual libertie of their Puſillanimous Peerage: Saying that Crabtree-grafts inoculated
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170382:27"/> in generous Stocks had quite ſpoil'd the Nurſerie of <hi>Candy.</hi> And indeed what by the effeminacy of that preſent State, whoſe long peace and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity had brought moſt of the Nobility to that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy; that as their Spirits were averſe from the Exerciſes of Arms; ſo were their intellectual parts and inward abilities ſo weakned, or rather eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from civil Conſultations and affairs of State, as in their Election for Supply of ſuch qualified Perſons as might perform thoſe Offices of high Concern (and wherein their <hi>Top-branches</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi> of the eminenſt Families had been formerly imployed) there was not one found of all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous line capable of ſuch high undertaking: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better known to a Game at Tenis: then the performance of any State-ſervice.</p>
            <p>Thus paſt theſe times with many viciſſitudes and turns: while the Palms of Peace ſo impaled the Frontiers of <hi>Candy,</hi> as it had no occaſion to dream of an Enemy. Mean while, the Court had wars; but they were amorous Encounters: Foes, but they were Corrivals. Amongſt which <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> that conſtant Favorite, and <hi>Iſmenia's</hi> indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Platonick, continued his viſits, being encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the Princeſs Connivence and her Ladies eaſie admittance; who uſually attended her, to purſue his queſt. Which could not be carried on with ſuch ſecreſie: but it became an Argument of private Diſcourſe amongſt thoſe Court-Ladies: who could no way ſhadow nor conceal the joy they apprehended upon their Princeſs reduction to her former Career of Pleaſure: the onely Object which their affectionate libertie aimed at. In this
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170382:28"/> number, but much different from their nature, was one <hi>Aretina,</hi> a Perſon of vertuous and choice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute: and one nearly allyed to <hi>Melidorus:</hi> who hearing with what Freedom this private Cenſure had diſpers'd it ſelf amongſt thoſe Ladies of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: and how much it derogated from her kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Fame; which ſhe ſo highly valued: as ſhe could not with patience, (being otherwiſe of a Compoſed temper) heare them whiſper touching any ſuch Platonick Encounter, if it reflected on <hi>Melidorus;</hi> but ſhe would ſtand up in vindication of his honour, not without ſharpe reproof of the greateſt Lady, who out of an aſſumed Confidence durſt oppoſe her. Till at laſt convinc'd with preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant probabilities of uſuall Platonick viſits: and thoſe at unſeaſonable times: which might beget Foments of jealouſie to ſuſpicious Eyes: and of rumour enough to jealous Eares: as one extaſed with a pious tender of her kinſmans honour; ſhe ſet pen to paper, expreſſing her diſcontents in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his bleeding Fame, after this manner: tranſcribed from her own ſtile and character.</p>

                  <p>Give me leave, <hi>Melidorus,</hi> to come home to you: the leaſt drop of blood that takes its courſe through your veines, cannot receive a ſtaine; but it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily beget in me a glowing bluſh; from our near relations and propinquity of Families.

            <p>This Letter, though it came from a Friendly hand and a Free heart; yet it wonderfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted <hi>Melidorus:</hi> Fearing, as he rightly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, that theſe ſuſpicious reports, though they bare not the face of truth; might by the miſ-interpretation of ſuch as were his Competitors; and maligners of his greatneſs, beget him an <hi>Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> with <hi>Baſilius:</hi> and by his incenſement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him an heavy Cenſure from the State.

               <hi>Foxes</hi> Eares were held for horns; he were a ſtout Orator that durſt oppoſe it. Upon a ſerious recollection therefore of his own waies: with a reſentment of his hazardous Condition, He fixt upon this reſult: to make uſe of ſuch Inſtruments in the Court; whoſe Credit might beare him up, againſt all traducing reports; which, though pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately diſpers'd, had not then got admittance to <hi>Baſilius</hi> eare: which though <hi>Cherſines,</hi> a ſecret E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of his ſought to accelerate, purpoſely to quicken his diſgrace; yet this Incendiary either failed in his opportunity of acting what he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned: or rather found the noble thoughts of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilius</hi> ſo orderly compoſed and fortified againſt all ſuch groundleſs ſurmizes, as he perceived all his Labour to be loſt, though he omitted no time to expedite his injurious aſſaies. Meane time, thoſe Perſons whom <hi>Melidorus</hi> had made uſe of to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his honour, expreſt themſelves Faithfull Agents in performing that Office of love which they had profeſſed. And in calming the rumor of thoſe reports, which had got too deep an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to be razed or removed at the firſt repulſe; <hi>Melidorus</hi> pretended himſelf ſick; to excuſe his abſence from the Court: and decline thoſe Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Viſits which he had uſually frequented. And to ſatisfie <hi>Aretina's</hi> deſires by way of Letter, in this his ſeeming languiſhing Condition (being more ſurpriz'd with feare of future cenſure and ingagement of honour, then any other diſtemper) He returned her an Anſwer to her ſevere reproof in this manner.</p>

You taxe me highly, <hi>Aretina,</hi> in asking me, if I had no other Miſtreſs, to preſent my Platonick ſervice to, but my Soveraigneſs! And I muſt anſwer you in the ſame dialect: that there was none to whom I ſtood more obliged in loyalty to ſerve: nor who deſerv'd in the Puncto of honour, the aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate attendence of a Subject more.

This I write from a ſick and languiſhing Bed, where our Proteſts ſhould be free from diſſembling; becauſe our weake Condition imports a probability of diſſolving. You tell me, that a Treaſure was committed to my truſt: and it were a violation of faith in me, to infringe that truſt in me repoſed: by ſuffering ſo precious a Treaſure to be injuriouſly impaired, imbezled or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached.

                  <p>But to curdle my blood the more: or infuſe (for rather ſo do I deſire to expound it) a religious loyall Feare in your Kinſmans breaſt; you offer to my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the inviolable Priviledges of a Princes Bed. Sure, you retaine a better Opinion of me, then your lines ſignifie. Can your diſcretion ſuggeſt this impoſture to you; that my late lightneſſe ſhould take away all thoughts of goodneſs? Or that I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch a ſenſuall Libertine; as for an inexpiable Act of levity, to ingage, nay, make forfeture of my Loyalty? Surely, if our <hi>blouds</hi> (as you write) ſo nearly participate; you cannot in charity, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety to your ſelf, judge ſo ſeverely of me; but you muſt feare ſome Corruption springing from your own veins; ſeeing, they ſo nearly partake with mine, as they derive their Origen from One Fountaine.

            <p>This Anſwer, though it were interlaid with ſome ſprinklings of a wormwood Lecture; infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely reliſhed the palat of <hi>Aretina:</hi> whoſe onely ſerious Object was the Salving of <hi>Melidorus</hi> ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected honour. Whereof ſhe appear'd the more tender, not onely in regard of their alliance: but of their joynt Education; the continued injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof had largely improved and highly inlarged this endeerment. This it was, that made his perſonal ſafety dear unto her; but much more, the Conſervation of his honour. Such lineal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence holds Fame in the deſcendent branches of a Family. But theſe lines coming from a ſick bed (as he pretended) became ſuch Cordial Receipts to <hi>Aretina's</hi> jealous thoughts; as ſhe could not apprehend the leaſt conceipt of her Kinſmans miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage: appearing upon all occaſions, a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Champion in defence of his honour. But all ſuch fears (as we formerly touched) had their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from Sandy grounds. For neither did <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> frequent viſits merit any ſuch Conſtruction, nor the free admittance of <hi>Iſmenia</hi> (a Princeſs of unqueſtion'd fame) any ſuch irregular traduce. Her
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170382:32"/> too much freedom onely might deſervingly incur Cenſure. Seeing Princes and eminent Perſons ſhew their glory beſt at diſtance. Whereas too generall and familiar intercourſe begets either an apparent Contempt; or diſvalue to their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Neither, indeed, ſhould Cenſure rack it ſelf to the higheſt pin, could it fall heavier upon <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi> then upon her too frequent repaire to Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Concourſe, as Theatral Preſentments with other Publick Solemnities: and that with ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy and nakedneſs of Reteiners; as ſhe appeared much below her ſelf. Yet thoſe who were more intimately known to her diſpoſition, could more candidly ſhadow this: and acquaint the World, how her ſmallneſs of Retinue proceeded not from any narrow nor parcimonious humour: but rather from a deſire of retirement from popular aſpect: coming more to ſee then to be ſeen: and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting theſe publick places of Reſort, not to make choice (as ſome ſiniſterly expounded it) of Servants or Favorites ſuitable to her affection: but to heare the humours of the time wittily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and to life acted: which might (as ſhe of times expreſt) highly deſerve the applauſe and approvement of the Eminenteſt Perſons. In her coming abroad ſhe retained no unuſuall port nor magnificence of State; leſt it might beget in her an opinion of pride, which was ever a ſtranger to her thoughts: but in her princely demeane ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable and debonaire, as ſhe ever returned a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aſpect and pleaſing ſalute to all Perſons accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their quality and degree: which in every place gave her an addition to her demerited ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170382:32"/> with arguments of popular affection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhe appeared. And to leave her a reall Character; before ſhe take her laſt farewell of her Court with all other Earthly injoyments: ſhe never made Choice of any Favorite as a light Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick, to leſſen her Spouſall affection; though the Corruption of time, and levity of ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons about her, were apt enough to beſtow their Cenſure, upon reflection of their own vicious Condicion; (judging all to be like unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,) on the abſoluteſt Objects of Honour. Her gallantry too, mixt with a princely compaſſion, was in this remarkable: That She never preſented any Suit to the prejudice of the State: but for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of ſuch as were injured, a ready Supplicant. But <hi>Candy</hi> was not worthy of her; for ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, having her body much inflamed through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate exerciſe (which ſhe purpoſely uſed to bring down her body, naturally inclining to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulency;) or through intemperate Bathing, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers opinion'd: or through exceſs of Hydroptick humours daily increaſing and ſurprizing her; with a compoſed and more then a Feminine ſpirit ſhe paid her debt to nature. But before her departure, to leave a teſtimony to the World of her untainted honour; She deſired much that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilius,</hi> her endeered Spouſe might be ſent for: in whoſe preſence, and accompanied with ſundry Ladies of Honour; She disburdned her ſelf of what troubled her moſt: expreſſing her Sufferings in this manner.</p>

And what with grief I speake in this my approaching Period, the Innocent oftimes incurred the heavieſt Cenſure: while others by a ſmooth palliating of their lightneſſe; preſerved their Fame, though not the Eſſence of their Honour. Amongst thoſe unhappy ones, I my ſelf might be numbred; yet in this I accompt my ſelf happy, that your pure and noble thoughts, my Lord, were forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt all thoſe Criminall aſperſions: for which I humbly thank you.

            <p>But to go on with the Continuation of our Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; we ſhall not here much need to dilate upon thoſe Ritual Ceremonies obſerved at the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that incomparable Princeſs. Let it ſuffice, that nothing was omitted, which might properly tend to the Solemnization of thoſe Royal Obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies, either for magnificence of State, then which no Ceremonial more ſumptuous: nor confluence of Attendance, then which none ever more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. Neither were her Funerals accompanied
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170382:35"/> with more ſolemnity of ſtate, nor affluence of charge, then an univerſal ſorrow of the whole Court: ſo generally was this Excellent Lady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and bemoaned. The ſad Prince, her wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed Conſort, now deprived of ſo ineſtimable a Jewel; as became a careful Father, begun to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect himſelf: and lay a proviſion, both for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Education and future preferment of thoſe deer Pledges which were left him by his affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Iſmenia.</hi> By whom he had two Sons; of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent diſpoſitions: For <hi>Cyrenius,</hi> the Elder was wholly addicted to the Campe: but <hi>Roſicles</hi> the younger to his Book, wherein he grew a ſingular Proficient. Now the fame of <hi>Cyrenius</hi> his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful valour became ſo diſperſed and rumor'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; as many, and thoſe of approved Judgment, were of opinion, that it abridg'd his daies: and that ſome neighbouring Prince emulating, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fearing his riſing ſpirit and incomparable cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; practiſed by ſome inferiour Inſtruments (unworthy the ſtile of ſo eminent a Profeſſion) his ſpeedy diſpatch. Though ſome others, quite of another opinion, (to vindicate, perchance, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of their Country) and that he dyed upon a Surfet of grapes taken in <hi>Natolia.</hi> But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Opinion might appear more probable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of a diſtaſtful meſſage which this hopeful Prince, no long time before his Sickneſs, had ſent to his Fathers Enemy: and nearly confining to his Native Country: <q>That he was then bandying balls with his Racket: but it ſhould not be long, till he had caſten thoſe Balls into another Mould: which the ſtrongeſt Forts and Fortreſſes in his
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170382:35"/> Kingdom ſhould ſhortly hear of.</q> But touching the manner of his death, it is the ſafeſt way to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend our judgment, being ſo variouſly deſcanted, and not as yet poſitively reſolved. Let us onely conclude, great was his Fame, and premature his Fate: being One, on whom all <hi>Candy</hi> treaſured their hope. <hi>Baſilius</hi> being now reſt in his declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing years of ſo ſtrong a ſtay and ſtaffe to his age; took advice of the Council of his State, what Match might be held moſt ſuitable for the young Prince his Son <hi>Roſicles,</hi> the onely remainder of his Line: and Supportance of his decreaſing life.</p>
            <p>Various and different were the Councils opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this grand Conſult; but at laſt, like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lines cloſing in one centre, they unanimouſly concluded; that the young Princeſſe of <hi>Hetruria</hi> was the ſuitableſt Match for ſtate, ſtrength and correſponding alliance that could be made choice of: and to expedite this main concern (the ſpeedy progreſſion whereof <hi>Baſilius</hi> infinitely importun'd) <hi>Silures</hi> a Court-Favorite; &amp; one of eminent eſteem with <hi>Baſilius,</hi> was deſigned to be his Attendant and Interpreter in his addreſs to the <hi>Hetrurian</hi> Court. And to return you a character of this <hi>Silures;</hi> He was of a graceful and winning deportment: of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing diſcourſe and Courtly preſence: though much affected to a native lightneſs: which he could art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhadow (albeit the help of Moral Arts had not much enabled him) and delude the Eye of his Obſerver with a formal colour of pretended mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty. Which he might eaſily do; for though not in <hi>Books,</hi> yet ſufficiently had he by his long reſide
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170382:36"/> and converſe in Court, read in <hi>Men,</hi> how he might beſt pleaſe: and fall off too, with beſt advantage in palliating his unmanag'd affections. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent artifice, which he uſually practiſed, in his Morning Sacrifice to his Glaſs and conſtant vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits of attractive beauties!</p>
            <p>It is above belief with what general acceptance and princely entertain, <hi>Roſicles</hi> this vertuous Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was received: nay admitted to the preſence of <hi>Parthenia</hi> (an unwonted freedom in that Court) and not onely ſo, but to enter into free parliance of Sponſal love with this incomparable Lady. Whoſe Princely appearance held ever ſuch a comely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: as it did neither promiſe too much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, nor averſeneſs in the Object of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Many daies were not paſt in theſe Love-purſuing Treaties; till the inamour'd <hi>Roſicles</hi> might raiſe his living hopes to a probable fruition of his deſires, if <hi>Lycanthes</hi> Father to his indeared choice, would anſwer the fair Propoſals of his aged Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his clear aſſent and approvement. Which was ſo quickly and cheerfully ſeconded, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wanting to conſummate their happineſs (ſo individually were their hearts united) but thoſe Sacred Rites, which admit all Loving Pairs a free enjoyment of what their longing thoughts ſo eagerly purſued.</p>
            <p>But alas; what ſprinklings of bitterneſs inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixe themſelves amidſt the abſoluteſt ſweetes! You ſhall heare a Cataſtrophe unexpectly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying this amorous Comedy. A diverſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Conceipt: and beneath Fear. Which (not to perplex your thoughts with unneceſſary delaies,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170382:36"/> apt to tyre your Fancy: nor fruitleſs digreſſions to ſurcharge your memory) befell in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Silures,</hi> a Perſon ſingularly accompliſh'd, as far as the Court of <hi>Candy</hi> could compleat him; being no leſs confident of his own abilities, then what Nature or the imbelliſhments of Art could confer upon him; became infinitely taken with <hi>Valeria,</hi> an incomparable beauty of the <hi>Hetruri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Court. Whom onely (being as yet in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of his affection) he attempted to make his, by amorous interbreaths, paſſionate ſighs, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſignall arguments, legible enough to any judgment that had ever practis'd the ſervice of a Miſtreſs: or had read a Lecture of Love. But <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leria,</hi> a Lady no leſs wiſe then faire, knew well enough how to vye with him at that Game: and could beſtow a Look, where ſhe never ment to fixe her Love. Neither did it behove Her, to be too li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall in the throwing forth of thoſe affectionate Lures: being married to a Gentleman of a noble Family: and beyond compare, gracious in the eye of the Court. Truth is, <hi>Roſicles</hi> could not be more hot in the purſuit of his legall addreſſes: then <hi>Silures</hi> was in his prohibited delights. Never was more paſſion ſhown in fewer words: nor more reall love, as it was ſhadowed, with more ſilence. This the Lady obſerv'd, joying much that her taking beauty, whereof her Morning-Glaſs had ſufficiently dictated to her, ſhould pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe her ſo ſpeedy and unexpected a victory. Neither is it to be queſtion'd, but that Eminent Ladies who know the value and attractive effects of beauty, triumph in nothing more then in this
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170382:37"/> Soveraignty of love: taking uſually more content in their Command, then Fruition of that Object whereto they pretend.

Meane time, <hi>Silures</hi> fearing that his long forbearing to deliver his devotionall affection to her; might beget in her either a Conceipt of weakneſs and timidity: or of coolneſs and indifferency in the purſuit of his Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;<note place="margin">Which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and deſigned by <hi>Tripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Court Coy-duck, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> He reſolv'd one day (and better opportunity could not be poſſibly preſented him) being in a cloſe Myrtle Arbour, where he addreſſed his Firſt Encounter: And where in the beſt dreſs and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of love (diſclaiming all further acquaintance with dull ſilence) He diſcovered the reality of a faithfull Servant in this ſort.</p>
            <p>Madam, Excuſe my Former ſilence; whereto an unexpreſſible affection and Zeal to your ſelf did injoyne me: and now my boldneſs in this admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of my preſentment of his affectionate ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, who remains wholly dedicated to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours diſpoſall: holding his life in this onely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that it may beſtow it ſelfe on the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Commands.</p>
            <p>Noble Sir; ſaid She, you highly oblige me in this immerited Character you are pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow: neither is it in me with any equivalent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to regratiate you: onely know, that there is no reſpect confined to the limits of honour, which I ſhall not with much promptneſs re-tender you. But truſt me. dear Sir, theſe private Addreſſes and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170382:37"/> ſhady Retirements ſuit not well with our Habit. And beſhrow me, if I can conjecture how my Spouſall innocence ſhould be betrayed to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected intercourſe.</p>
            <p>How, Madam, betrayed! I hope your affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate thoughts are far from harbouring ſuch a ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Conceipt. We may prove Traitors to our own ſurprized hearts, by too intentive fixing on ſuch incomparable Subjects of fancy; but for you, <hi>Divine Souls,</hi> to be betray'd by your Servants, who make the purſuit of your Commands their ſupreme happineſs; were ſuch a Ridle, as the wiſeſt Lover could never aſſoyle: nor whoſe violation the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouteſt Flamins abſolve. Such reall Servants were rare attractive Adamants, quoth ſhe, in theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purer times; where plauſive pretences weave up the webbe of a deceiving Fancy: and ſelf-intereſt, or to give its proper attribute, ſenſuall delight, bear ſway in Loves Regiment.</p>
            <p>Surely Madam, it has been your unhappy For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to encounter with ungratefull or indiſcreet Servants upon this relation. For he deſerves not the injoyment of a deſerving Miſtreſs; who to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh her content; would not hold the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his life a competent gage for ſuch a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe.</p>
            <p>May you reſt ever happy, anſwer'd <hi>Valeria,</hi> in the enjoyment of ſuch a Miſtreſs; that may merit the conſtant attendance of ſo deſerving a Servant. Love is ever beſt ballanc'd with love: neither can there be any Eclipſe in that <hi>Paſſion:</hi> where good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may challenge an influence over affection.

            <p>For loves ſake, Madam, what Mortall ſo ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignizingly commanding, or by the deſtinies ſo powerfully inabled, that has ſuch Priviledg over your beauty, as to make of it a Monopoly? Muſt the Splendor of that <hi>Sun</hi> which might diffuſe its beames upon the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> be confined to one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle? Is Nature ſo prodigall to One; and ſo parci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious to Others? Reflect upon your incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable indowments, and that priority of Feature in relation to your exquiſite Compoſure (Excellent Lady) and ſure you cannot be ſuch an Enemy to your ſelf; as to encloiſter thoſe accompliſhments, which even humane Society had ordain'd to be Communicable. What do you meane by <hi>Encloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring?</hi> A Spouſall Condition ſuits not with a Cloiſter; anſwered <hi>Valeria.</hi> But give me leave to informe your judgement better, leſt you might ſuffer by inclining to an irrevocable Error. In your overvaluing my low abilities, you highly derogate from his Perfections to whom I owe my ſelf. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I otherwiſe think, but that the Clearneſs of your Intellect has already diſcovered a flaw in my Judgment; to make there my Choice, where there might be a probable deſire or admittance of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170382:38"/> Change. Pray Sir, acquaint me; be your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Ladies ſo apt to receive Servants: or to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the pretended affection of a Forraigner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condigne Cenſure? Reputation, Sir, I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you is here in <hi>Hetruria,</hi> held an Ornament of higher value. Neither ſhall that word of <hi>Priority,</hi> which your rare dialect beſtows upon me, beget in me a Conceipt above merit: or too credulous an attention to a perſonall praiſe, taking breath rather from volubility of dialect and Facility of tongue; then grounded effects and ſolidity of truth. For my part, Sir, ſince I firſt breath'd Court aire, I have ever reap'd more profit by diſ-eſteem then ſelf-eſteem. The one lifts us up, and tranſports us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of Reaſon, by preſenting to our deluded Fancies, imaginary ſhadows of our own Conceipted Excellence; which always cloſeth with a dangerous Cataſtrophe, by inſlaving our ſelvs to our own Fancy. Whereas a juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem of our own abilities may be properly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to that exquiſite Receipt which the wiſe <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſſes</hi> carefully uſed to decline thoſe Siren-ſugred inchantments which had miſerably inveagled and ſurprized him, if he had not ſeaſonably prevented thoſe perilous Charms by Cautious Fears.</p>
            <p>Neither would I have you think, Noble Sir, but if there were in me any ſuch priority as you plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly pretend, but that perſon who has all right and juſt propriety in it, ſhould without danger of Competition ſolely enjoy it.</p>
            <p>This reſolution of <hi>Valeria</hi> leſſened the hopes of <hi>Silures</hi> in this amorous Suit: yet not ſo wholly diſcouraged him; as with this eaſie repulſe wholly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170382:39"/> to raiſe his Siege: And the rather, for that he had formerly received ſome private Encourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch perſons as had more intimate knowledge of <hi>Valeria's</hi> plyable diſpoſition: that her native levity ſeconded by the delicacy of her Education could aſſure him of no leſs ſucceſs, then a graceful accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and admittance to the fruition of what he ſued for: if ſome light skirmiſhes and ſlight repulſes did not amate his Spirit: nor tire his patience with delays. Neither, indeed, could <hi>Silures</hi> promiſe to his hopes leſs happineſs, upon his laſt encounter and their departure one from the other. For ſhe beſtow'd upon him ſuch an affectionate ſmile in her recede from the Arbour, as it could aſſure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs then an aſſurance of a further Favour: though her reſolution ſeem'd to be of a more relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctant and unmalleable temper. Such ſingular art have ſome women attain'd in preſenting ſmooth Looks and ſpeaking Eyes; when their Expreſſes are with moſt niceneſſe and ſubtiltie palliated. Mean time, her noble Conſort, <hi>Verſivalo;</hi> though he had apparent grounds of ſuſpecting much; yet his ſtrong opinion and long Experience of her Conſtancy, made his clear thoughts ſtrangers to Fear. For as ſhe was held for beauty and bravery in all the <hi>Hetrarian</hi> Court moſt abſolute: ſo her uſual rejection of ſundry Perſons of eminent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem had confirm'd her a Counteſs of incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Continence. All this time, Prince <hi>Roſicles</hi> no leſs ſolicitouſly then ſucceſſively purſued his Queſt. Neither was <hi>Parthenia's</hi> endeavours, to perfect their longing deſires, &amp; ceremonially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat what their mutual affections had already
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170382:39"/> ſigned. Nothing unaſſay'd not left unacted that might uſefully conduce to the final accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this great Addreſs. For <hi>Lycanthes</hi> Father to <hi>Parthenia,</hi> had wholly condeſcended to all ſuch Propoſals or Articles of Marriage as were return'd him by <hi>Silures:</hi> with other additional emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, manifeſt expreſſions of his entire affection to <hi>Roſicles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But honeſt Nuptial love was not onely here in agitation: <hi>Silures</hi> had quite forgot his Office of an Intelligencer; through the purſuit of an inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Lover. He prefers the purchaſe of <hi>Valeriae,</hi> if he might have the fortune to obtain it, before any other imployment, were it never ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, whereto in loyalty he ſtood obliged. To prepare then his amorous addreſs: and to bring his continued Motion to a fair period and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; being flanker'd with ſundry officious Agents; who <hi>nibling</hi> at the <hi>Bait</hi> of <hi>Reward;</hi> the attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt booty to ſervile Spirits; promiſed not onely their beſt aſſiſtance, but aſſur'd him of preſent ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, if his <hi>Honour</hi> would give way to their advice. Being then not onely put on but infinitely incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by theſe officious Inſtruments to the re-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of this Excellent Lady; and having preſented her firſt with a rich Carknet (a Preſent intended for princely <hi>Partheniae,</hi> but deteined by <hi>Silures</hi> as a Reſerve for a depraved beauty;) He labours with far more Courtly art then moral honeſty or real modeſty, to delineate his Paſſions begot of ill Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in this manner.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170382:40"/> with more admiration then affection. For her pure innocent thoughts had never given harbour to the admittance of a light or licentious Suiter. Neither could ſhe imagine by whoſe means or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Suggeſtion this Credulous Stranger ſhould become ſo confident of a Conqueſt; ſeeing their laſt intercourſe promiſed nothing leſs. Many waies did ſhe caſt about to retreive this Secreſie: and with much adoe ſhe came to a diſcovery of this grand Deſign (a ſeeming Project of undermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or betraying honour) which, to avoid imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent digreſſions, had been thus contrived.</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Argiricidas,</hi> a profeſt Broaker in illegitimate Contracts: who underſtanding with what impetuous ſollicitancy <hi>Silures</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun'd the affection of <hi>Valeria;</hi> pretending his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with this Lady, offer'd him his ſervice: and how he doubted not but to become a prevalent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in this Employment, if he pleaſed to tranſmit the Carriage of ſo high a Concern to his manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſpoſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argiricidas</hi> could not be more apt to ingratiate (in which art he was ſingular, being his Maſter-prize) then Love-tranſported <hi>Silures</hi> to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: grounding his belief on this mercenary A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents pretence of his known eſteem in the Court: and his eaſie acceſſe and prevalency with this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; on whom he ſo infinitely doated. No Ear could be more credulouſly attentive to this Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors plauſive incouragements: promiſing him an ample reward upon his ſucceſs; which with a frontleſs boldneſs he aſſur'd him, ſhould every way anſwer his deſires. Many daies were not paſt,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170382:41"/> till this deluding Sollicitor thirſty of the reward promiſed him; without ever imparting his Suit to the Lady: or remonſtrance of <hi>Silures</hi> affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction continued to her; he frames a Letter and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects it to this pitiful perplexed Lover in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

                  <p>Sir; you have heard how frequent drops will pierce the hardeſt ſtone; and I have found it true. That Breast which ſeem'd lately as impenetrable as a Rock of Adamant; by much working (as what meanes unaſſay'd that might ſucceſſively operate to the iſſue of this deſigne:) becomes ſenſible of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of love: and the apprehenſion of a deſerving and obſequious Servant. The Conqueſt is got; and your way laid to arrive at the Port of your deſires. This Task, I must needs confeſs, had it not been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued ſeriouſly and ſeaſonably, had irrecoverably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd before it had attained its maturity. But your intereſt made my Morning Viſits and Evening atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance equally pleaſing.</p>
                  <p>The very laſt day I had acceſs unto her, and upon this Theme took occaſion to converſe with her, was crowned with ſo cheerfull an Evening; as her grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full complyance and aſſent infinitely ſweetned and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered my doubtfull endeavours: much like a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Traveller, who chafed with ſultry heat, allays the extremity of his toyle and heat with the ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble refreſhment of a ſhady Arbour or coole Chriſt all Spring.

            <p>A rare boldneſs! This Letter of Credence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; his reward returned: and <hi>Silures</hi> with ſuch aiery hopes ſtrangely tranſported, as inſtead of brains, his head is wholly taken up with Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meras. And theſe were the grounds of <hi>Silures</hi> confidence: wherewith the wiſeſt man might have been deluded; much more a fantaſtick Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. This it was that caus'd him to play the part of a Conceipted Secretary: and like another <hi>Ixion</hi> to be couzen'd with a Cloud. For we ſhall go on in a continued Maze of Errors: and in our extrication find them all highly reflecting on <hi>Silures</hi> honour.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Valeria</hi> had received that ſtrange Letter from the hand of her Confident Lover; ſhe knew not well what to make of it: but having found out the Author; ſhe reſolv'd to continuate this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: and to bring <hi>Silures</hi> to the knowledge of the Eſtimate of a Ladies honour: and to contrive this Scene the better; ſhe pretends love, where ſhe meanes not to place it: and under a colourable profeſſion, to preſent a Face of love, where ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intends to beſtow it. Neither, indeed, could his aſſiduate viſits and unſeaſonable Courtings do leſs then highly incenſe her: being a Lady of higheſt rank in Court: and the onely attractive Perſon for Majeſty and Beauty. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, One upon whom the Eyes of moſt of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minenteſt perſonages of honour were conſtantly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170382:42"/> fixed. Beſides, her Husband deſcended from one of the flouriſhingſt Families in all <hi>Mantua;</hi> might juſtly take it as a derogation to the quality of his Perſon, to have ſo daring an intruder preſſing into his Intereſt. Theſe Conſiderable Motives quickned her Revenge, and that in ſuch Exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite a manner: as nothing could extend to an higher degree of ſeverity in her: nor of more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy to him.</p>
            <p>And in this ſort ſhe moulds her Plot; not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her <hi>Conſorts</hi> aſſiſtance, as may be probably conjectur'd, holding himſelf equally concern'd in this inſolent attempt and inſupportable affront ſhown them both.

                  <p>Truſt me, Sir, ſuch pretenders to love, as you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be, (for your too prevalent lines have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd me to a Belief that your undiſcerning Choice has made me the Miſtreſs of your heart, and ſole Soveraigneſs of your affection) ſuch, I ſay, are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Pioners to converſe with. For in truth, we cannot challenge any propriety in our ſelves; ſo long as it is in your hand to draw the latch of our affection; which by your perſwaſion and over-working, becomes
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170382:42"/> capable of any impreſſion. We muſt then with Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be caſten in your Mould: and appear fraile veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels at the pleaſure of the Moulder.</p>
                  <p>I dare not ſay I love you; and yet, methinks, my Tongue begins to taxe me; nay, in expreſs words tell me, that my dialect is not true. My Boſome too, which has been ever a profeſt Stranger to unlawfull heats; ſhould I whisper to it a Tale of Forraigne Love; it would turne Infidel and not believe me: having ever held ſuch diſtance with Paſſions of that quality.— But ay me! I muſt love, you ſay: and I muſt ingenuouſly confeſs, my Frailty, and your Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor perplexe me a thouſand waies in returne of my Anſwer. But the Suit is ſoon obtain'd, where the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner may play the Commander, by challenging an influence upon the Party to whom He preſents his Suit.—Go to Sir, you muſt play the Conquerour; but let me conjure you, by all thoſe religious proteſts which you have ſo frequently and fervorouſly brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed: and with ſo many ceremonious atteſts confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that you triumph not too much in your Spoile; let it be ſufficient for your goodneſſe to have gained the Gole, whereto the inſtancy of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires aſpired. Do not blemiſh that which your Judgment has ſo highly valued. That Lapidary might be juſtly tax'd of indiſcretion or want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg; who will careleſly ſuffer a Foile to be laid on that Gemme or Pearle which he eſteemes of price: you have ſince your firſt ſollicitancy ſet your honour at an high rate. Be equally tender of both our Fames in this relation. Let not the fruition of your deſires make you too laviſh in your expreſs: nor too immoderate in your Exceſs of joy. Theſe might prove two ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170382:43"/> precipices to both our honours; which I am confident your diſcreet love will ſtudy to decline in this purſuit and injoyment of — I know not how to render it, a mutuall acquieſcence of a dangerous prohibited pleaſure. As you tender then the <hi>Object,</hi> to whom you pretend ſo high an honour, in this your affectionate Cariere, (which muſt be aſſented to, becauſe, ſo preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Suiter commands it) let this be your prime En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour. You have obliged me many ways by votive Expreſſions, powerfull lines and now in Tokens. To regratiate which tribute, I ſhall aſſure you Sir, by the word of honour; that SHE, whom by all likelihood you are to injoy, ſeeing it cannot be otherwiſe preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhall weare that Pledge of yours as an indeered Favour upon your acceſs and private admittance to her. This is enough; could lines bluſh, I had not writ ſo much: yet if my Jealouſie of intercepting theſe lines had not ſuggested to my timerous ſpirit freſh Feares, I had inlarged my ſelf more.

            <p>The gladſome Receipt of this Letter ſo ſtrangely ſurpized the deluded thoughts of our inamoured <hi>Silures;</hi> as he found that ancient Adage true by his own Experience: <hi>Delay was bitter in the Queſt of love.</hi> With winged Speed He reſolves to purſue his tender'd Intereſt: and upon his acceſs to her, finds her caſten in a new Mould. Her deportment had made it ſelf a ſtranger to niceneſs. No look but it retein'd a relation to love. Nothing could be delivered by him, but it did infinitly pleaſe. And to cloſe this intercourſe with a pleaſing Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170382:43"/> time, place with all conveniencies are deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the accompliſhment of his deſires: from the Expediting whereof <hi>Valeria</hi> ſhewed no averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at all.</p>
            <p>When the Phebean Charriot after a long dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory progreſs (for ſo it appeared to <hi>Silures</hi>) had finiſhed his Courſe: and given way to <hi>Latona</hi> with her Sable Curtains to ore-canopy the inferiour Orbe; it was no time for this longing Amoriſt to foreſlow his admittance to his imaginary <hi>Valeria:</hi> being made ſo well acquainted with his Lodging: and with what privacy, without the Conduct of any Lights, He was directed to enter the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in relation to her honour, whom he did ſo incomparably tender. Where He found a Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow, but of another hue, though he could not at firſt diſcover it, then he expected. But feeling the Carknet about her neck, which <hi>Valeria</hi> had writ unto him, 'Even <hi>ſhe</hi> ſhould weare, whom by all probability He was to enjoy; apprehending no Fallacy in it; as one ſatisfied with his Choice; He lay cloſe inwreath'd in the armes of his uncouth Conſort an Expoſed Proſtitute; a Mooriſh Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, of an obſcure quality, an infectious and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed body. So as, when the Sun had diſplay'd his burniſh'd locks, his radiant ſplendor over the Univerſe: and Morpheus cloyed with a long nights ſlumber, had drawn aſide his Curtains, that he might better diſcover the deformity of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; in a Furious and madding paſſion, as one quite diſtracted with that ugly Object of his loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed pleaſure; <hi>Silures</hi> leaps out of his Bed, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revenge for this his unexemplary diſhonour,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170382:44"/> if either Force or Policy could poſſibly contrive it. But for the preſent, he held no Practiſe more uſeful, not for effecting his revenge more behoov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; then to make it his principall deſign (a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe moſt prejudiciall to the State of <hi>Candy</hi>) how to diſſolve that Treaty of Marriage; by cooling the affection of Prince <hi>Roſicles</hi> to his vertuous <hi>Parthenia,</hi> and to commence a difference betwixt the two States of <hi>Hetruria</hi> and <hi>Candy.</hi> This deſign admitted no protraction: for though he could not with all his ſubtile and ſerpentine perſwaſions aliene the grounded affection of <hi>Roſicles</hi> to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Lady: ſo deeply were thoſe impreſſions fixed: yet by incendiary Letters privately and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily tranſmitted to the old King; who through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of years and decreaſe of conſtancy in adhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to advice, became wholly led by the Councell of his Favorites: amongſt whom, none more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, nor in higher truſt then <hi>Silures.</hi> Such was the liberty of the time: and the infelicity of a State to derive their advice and aſſiſtance from thoſe <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing Statiſts,</hi> who either would not, or could not manage thoſe high conſiderable affaires ſo main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conducing to the ſafety, peace and ſecurity of their Countrey. Now <hi>Silures,</hi> this corrupt Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligencer, highly inflam'd with the ſwelling Fury of an implacable revenge, amongſt other pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Meſſages meerly commenced without Colour of Truth; advertiſed the Councell of State, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſuch as were Feathers of his wing) what derogation it would be to the Flouriſhing Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of <hi>Candy</hi> to become ſubject to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of an Inferiour State; which he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ready made ſo bold with their Prerogative Royall; nay, with the antient Creſts and Signals of their Princes Family: as they bluſhed not to quarter his Coat: and to boaſt publickly, how the Conſtitution of our State of <hi>Candy,</hi> was raiſed out of aſhes by the <hi>Hetrurian</hi> valour.</p>
            <p>Theſe Relations, raked up from the Cinders of Revenge, which <hi>Silures</hi> had ſo lately imboſom'd, ſo highly incenſed thoſe inconſiderate Statiſts, to whom his Letters were directed, as with joint voice and vote they reſolv'd to make their addreſs to <hi>Baſilius</hi> the old King, and to importune the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his aſſent for diſſolving the Treaty with the <hi>Hetrurian</hi> Prince, and for calling back his Son <hi>Roſicles,</hi> with expreſs Command of forbearing to proceed in any ſuch intentional way of Alliance. This was no ſooner propoſed by thoſe young Statesmen; then it was readily inclined to by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilius.</hi> Whoſe content reſted principally in a free indulging of his aged appetite, rather then any management or addreſs of State.</p>
            <p>It is not eaſie to apprehend the grief nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed diſtemper of <hi>Roſicles</hi> upon receipt of this ſevere and unwelcom Meſſage. But <hi>Silures</hi> ſo
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170382:45"/> deeply blanched with diſhonour, haſtened his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; but appeared as one wholly guiltleſs and unknown to the grounds of any ſuch Command. But he could not ſo artfully nor ſubtilely colour it; but moſt of the eminenſt Perſons converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Court, were acquainted with the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it: and afterwards became a Comical Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (or a Satyrical ſubject rather) to the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt and exquiſiteſt <hi>Roſcio's</hi> about the Court, both to exerciſe their Fancies, and actively to preſent them. Though the <hi>Hetrurian</hi> Prince diſtaſting ſuch invective Preſentments, out of a native mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and princely clemency, prohibited all ſuch detractive Scenes, darting perſonally upon any ones honour, to be publickly acted.</p>
            <p>Now muſt we leave <hi>Parthenia</hi> bemoaning her hard fate; to be thus deſerted without cauſe: and divided from the abſolute Object of her pure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection without ground. So as ſhe remained over-reſolv'd to bid adue to the world: and to betake herſelf to a private Clauſtral life. Neither was it her purpoſe to alter that reſolve: had not more impreſſive advice or a ſuperiour Command diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her retired courſe: Being afterwards eſpouſed to a Prince of high Extraction: and ſingular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments: yet would ſhe never hear of any ſuch motion; till ſhe received certain intelligence of <hi>Roſicles</hi> marriage: ſo conſtantly and devotionally ſtood ſhe affected.</p>
            <p>It was high time now for <hi>Silures</hi> to pack away, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving run his Fame on ſo deſperate a Shelf: as thoſe very Foiſts &amp; Buffoons, who in an inferiour offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating way reteined to the Court, would uſually
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170382:45"/> point at him; and in a diſgraceful manner twit him; and ſay: <q>There ſtrutts that brave Forreigne In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligencer, who has lately got a ſtroake over ſhinnes with a <hi>French Faggot:</hi> or a Snappe by a <hi>Neapolitan Ferret.</hi>
               </q> It is eaſie then to imagin with what celerity he winged his Courſe, to decline his ſhame. No time was reſerv'd to take his long Farewell of his Grand Revenger <hi>Valeria</hi> nor his Moor <hi>Tripenſa:</hi> from whom He had received more then he could claw off in haſte: For that profeſt Haxter was noted for ſuch a Mercenary Proſtitute, as ſhe was held a dangerous Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant under the <hi>Torrid Zone:</hi> One, apt to infect more then a Publick Peſt.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Ladies then and dainty doxes of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trurian</hi> Court, muſt hold him excuſed; for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of thoſe Careſſes and Civile adues; which, if all things had gone right, had been, doubtleſly, return'd a with a gracefull and complementall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion.</p>
            <p>Now, ſuppoſe theſe two launching forth into the Maine Ocean; where Calme Seas and proſperous gales accompanied them: being far more ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in their Paſſage by Sea, then Addreſſe by Land: loſt in the One, but ſafely arriv'd by the clear Convoy and propitiouſneſs of the Other. And with ſuch aſſiſtance had <hi>Silures</hi> fortified his approach and acceſs to the Court of <hi>Candy:</hi> as all his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions were highly approved: his breach of the Match generally received as an incomparable Bleſſing to their State: inſtilling into vulgar Eares, who were apt to believe, what they had not the happineſs to conceive; that next to the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170382:46"/> of Heaven, They were to attribute the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and proſperous management of that great Act of State, to the cautious and circumſpect Carriage of <hi>Silures,</hi> in preventing by a timely fore-ſight the Concluſive Heads of that high and moſt Conſiderable Treaty. The production where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if once aſſented to, might have accelerated the ruine of <hi>Candy.</hi> Wherein ſome particulars were inſtanced, and thoſe mainly inſiſted on, to beget in their Commonalty the ſtronger belief of the happy iſſue of this prevention. As firſt, how the Principles of Politick Government had not been onely much weakned, but quite diſſolved by this Alliance: For the Forme and Method of their Soveraignty, was ever much different to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trurian</hi> Poſture: and ſo ambitious was the Nature of thoſe People; (ſo they pretended) as they would not be content with the free enjoyment of their own Priviledges and Nationall Conſtitutions, but they muſt invade others Liberties; by reducing their Laws to their ſcantling. Neither was this all the inconvenience that might probably occur to their Flouriſhing State by this incommodious Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance: For the diſcipline of their Church held no Conſent nor harmony with them. How warily then and wiſely was this prevented, e're any thing were poſitively concluded?</p>
            <p>Theſe Reaſons, though in an equall and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Skale, they might clearly appeare light and inconſiderable; they left ſuch Impreſſions in the hearts of the Citizens; as they accounted of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures</hi> for a <hi>Semi-deity;</hi> but if they had peruſed his Conditions rightly, they would have found him
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170382:46"/> a <hi>Light one</hi> (ſuch as the Poets feigned their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Gods to be:) but too much honour, as they thought, could not be conferred on a perſon of that quality; whoſe timely care and vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ilancy had preſerved their Country: by freeing them from that Juncto or Alliance, the Conſequence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of might have involv'd them in the miſeries of a perpetual Slavery. Theſe ſugred pretences were thoſe Motives, which caus'd them to receive him into the City with thoſe Applauſes and Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Bonefires, Conduits ſtreaming with wine; Theatral Shows and Preſentments both by Land and Water: with ſundry Encomiaſtick Peans in magnifying his actions (ſo ignorant was the pen of the quality of his merits;) whereby it appear'd, that theſe deluded Plebeians aſcribed more to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures</hi> lightneſs: then they did to <hi>Roſicles</hi> compoſed and temperate Carriage.</p>
            <p>But the prevention of this inſucceſſiue match muſt make way to a new Addreſs: For the hopes of the Kingdom being wholly treaſured in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Baſilius:</hi> and <hi>Roſicles</hi> the onely top-branch of that Royall Stemme; the neceſſity of his Election in the Choice of a Conſort, might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no long debate. <hi>Ferrara</hi> was the Place where He was to ſet up his reſt: and make his Choice. And this tractable Prince returns a faire and free Condeſcention to their definite reſolve: though the memory of <hi>Parthenia's</hi> perfections, then which none more accompliſh'd, retein'd in him that deep impreſſion, as his affianc'd heart could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find harbour for any new affection. But on he muſt to this re-addreſs, ſeconded by the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170382:47"/> of his late Intelligencer. Who though he pretended an indiſpoſition to health (as he might well, for the <hi>Fire</hi> was not yet quite out of the <hi>Furnace,</hi> nor his <hi>Cornelian Tub</hi> wholly removed) and by his Night-Cap, which he ſhadowed with the handſom pretext of an Hectick Fever; though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to cover the <hi>Scalpe</hi> of an <hi>Adamite,</hi> left as naked as a moulted Scaledrak: with his <hi>unarmed</hi> Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, for they had loſt their nails by faſtening too eagerly upon an infectious beauty: Though he might object theſe Infirmities (as never better vital parts were ſeaz'd of more) on he muſt to this new Adventure: wherein, no doubt, his late misfortune would make him more tender of preſerving the Conſtitution of his enfeebled Honour. Now to their Convoy and arrival.</p>
            <p>Their acceſs to the Court of <hi>Hetruria</hi> was not with more ſtate nor magnificence preſented to Prince <hi>Roſicles</hi> and his noble Retinue; then it was with a Majeſtick kind of diſtance at his firſt coming to Court, accoutred by the Prince and his daughter <hi>Irina;</hi> with whom he was, as the State had debated it, upon his departure from <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> to enter marriage. All the Court put on a ſhie countenance: nor did the Lady herſelf appear with leſs niceneſs, if at any time (which was rare) ſhe took occaſion to encounter <hi>Roſicles,</hi> or be in his preſence. The grounds of which ſtrangeneſs neither he nor his Intelligencer could at firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover; till one day an eſpecial Favorite, one who had been formerly educated in the Court of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> imparted his mind with much freedom unto <hi>Roſicles;</hi> unſhadowing to him what had appeared
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170382:47"/> before moſt intricate: and withall, that his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate zeal might be a-wanting in no conſiderable reſpect conducing to ſo fair an Addreſs, he chalks him forth away how he might alter the face of that ſtrangeneſs in his Miſtreſs: and poſſeſs the Court with a better opinion of him; then they had yet in their Entertaine demonſtrated. His words, upon their ſerious Conference in the Pallace Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, were theſe.</p>
            <p>Sir, I muſt ingenuouſly tell you, for I am none of theſe that would willingly delude you, having been formerly ſo much obliged to your Fathers Court for my Education; that your <hi>Highneſs</hi> goes the wrong way to the wood in this purſuit of your affection. The Princeſs of <hi>Ferrara</hi> bears a more ſupercilious front then to be content with the <hi>Gleanings</hi> of the compleateſt Suiter in <hi>Europe.</hi>

Let me then adviſe from that intimacy of ſervice I owe you; to make it your firſt Task to vindicate your honour; by making it appear to our Princeſs <hi>Iri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Theſe incouragements highly enlivened the drooping hopes of perplexed <hi>Roſicles:</hi> who with theſe unexpected oppoſitions had nearly razed out of his remembrance the late impreſſive Idea of his deſerted Miſtreſs.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>taſte, which brought her to this mature expoſtulation with her ſelf.</p>
            <p>How now <hi>Irina!</hi> Has time reſerv'd you for no imployment; but to beſtow your precious houres in peruſing letters that concerne you not? Play not the wanton fly in ſporting too much with the Flame of Fancy; leſt your ſing'd wings become a booty to Loves Fury. Ingage not your liberty to a Stranger, leſt the Forfeiture bring you off with diſhonour. What is <hi>Roſicles</hi> to <hi>Irina,</hi> or <hi>Irina</hi> to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170382:49"/> 
               <hi>Roſicles?</hi> Have you none to beſtow your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on; but on ſuch an One, as can ſuit his Fancy to all Objects: and pretend Faith, when he intends to colour it with the cunning artifice of Fraud? what priviledge of Exemption may you challenge above his deſerted <hi>Parthenia?</hi> None could (as it well appears, and I commiſerate her injuried condition) Sacrifice to Loves Altar with more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, nor unveil her Conjugal deſires with more innocent Candor; yet muſt ſhe be rejected where her affection was moſt individually fixed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extinguiſhably fired. An excellent cautionary Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture for an inconſiderate Lover. Deſiſt then, and keep thine eyes within their Lodges: thy Fancy communicable to none but thine own Boſom. This will ſecure thee from the thraldom of a light Suiter: and return thee a freedom of enjoying thy ſelf, incomparably more valuable then theſe ceremonious proteſts of any Complemental Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The whole world (if thou ſhouldſt take thy Survey) preſents but in a Land-skip, a continued counterfet <hi>Love-mask;</hi> wherein appears variety of Faces, but they are not native nor genuine; but borrowed vizards. And, ſure, if <hi>Paint</hi> be ſo odious a tincture to real beauty; what may we think of theſe adulterate Colors of painted Fancy: when we ſeem leaſt that we are: and are moſt what we ſeem leaſt?—But ay me! Tenderd love, which may be real and without any ſuch flaw, merits no ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy conſtruction: nor any ſuch Criticiſm. Digeſt then thy thoughts better: and ſuſpend thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till truth, the daughter of time ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Carriage in that <hi>Hetrurian</hi> Suit: with all
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170382:49"/> the Circumſtances neceſſarily accompanying ſo main and important an addreſſe. Neither will this appear a Task of any ſuch difficulty as not to be atcheived: being purſued with induſtry, and diſcreet ſecreſie. I am confident a politick head might (if all other wayes were obſtructed) plough the ground with his own Heifers: and that I hold to be the cleareſt and expediteſt courſe.</p>
            <p>It were eaſie to gather by this pretty amorous Expoſtulation, how <hi>Irina</hi> for all her pretended motion or averſion from the ſuit of <hi>Roſicles,</hi> ſtood cordially affected: which ſhe more clearly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by her diligent inquiry.</p>

            <p>Madam <hi>Euriola,</hi> none can more punctually ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie your obliging Commands in this Relation then my ſelf; which I ſhall do more willingly; becauſe it may vindicate the honour of ſome who have the neareſt intereſt in it: and lay the blame
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170382:50"/> on thoſe who by their irregular comportment juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerve it. Moſt injuriouſly has our noble Prince been traduced: nay, privately tax'd, (ſo far as the malignancy of their report would paſs for current,) of levity and inconſtancy in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of his affection: And how ungratefully <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenia's</hi> loyall Expreſſes were requited. But theſe Criminations may be wiped off with an eaſie Spunge: For his faire and well-compos'd demeane was royally affectionate; his Carriage modeſt and temperate, in no Courſe diſ-proportionate to the Greatneſs of himſelf: deſiring nothing more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorouſly (and herein cloſed his deſires moſt Princely) then to have that buſineſs expedirely effected, which had been ſo generally approved and advanced. But I muſt tell you, my deereſt Miſtreſs, that there was an <hi>uncleane Beaſt</hi> (I muſt freely unboſome my ſelf to your Commands) that troubled the ſmooth paſſage of this Chriſtalline Current. One, who ſhould have been a principall Agent in promoting it: but bemoane a <hi>Remora</hi> in our Proceedings. For that amiable thred of love, which the Prince my Maſter; had woven: and by a mutuall contexture brought nearly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; (for no difference nor diſparity appeared in their Choice:) his ſenſuall deſires untwiſted: diſſolving in one day, what many weeks had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted: and what two equally united hearts had ſo freely entertained.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euriola</hi> here interrupting him; earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to know who might be the unhappy Actor of ſuch a miſchief?</p>
            <p>Excuſe your Servant, Madam, replyed <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:170382:50"/> I ſhall not much need to diſplay him any further: his diſhonour has more then ſufficiently publiſh'd his diſorder. He has been a Servant of ſuch long continuance unto ſenſe: as it has forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him againſt all ſhame. In one word, this <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barite,</hi> to give him according to his dimention a juſt Character; is a profeſt violator of honour: and to the grief of a diſtemper'd State be it ſpoken, an individuall Minion to Him who ſits at the Sterne. This is the Portraiture unto life of a light Intelligencer.</p>
            <p>So, ſaid <hi>Euriola;</hi> now I have you. I have heard him, indeed, call'd the Catamite of our time. But Fame is apt to belie thoſe that are in place. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, in this He ſhew'd himſelf an Inſtrument of unexemplary baſeneſs.</p>
            <p>Madam, you apprehend it rightly: and if with modeſty I could diſcover every particular, how it was projected and acted, it might make up an Annal to Poſterity, and leave the Actor to a ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiz'd memory. Lines cannot bluſh; I ſhall in a Scedule leave to my Excellent Miſtreſs, what I cannot returne with Freedom by way of diſcourſe. Penns be the beſt Pencils, where Pictures are to be ſhadowed: Or the Subjects we treat of, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowingly couched.</p>
            <p>Neither was <hi>Philaſter</hi> unmindfull of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for within few daies after, he returned <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riola</hi> a lively Story of <hi>Silures</hi> Folly. Which with all convenient ſpeed ſhe preſented to her Lady. Upon peruſall whereof, as the Narrative of the deluded Senſualiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, being taken in his own Gin, did much delight her: ſo the unexpected Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170382:51"/> of the two diſ-appointed Lovers did much perplex her.</p>
            <p>But above all others, that ſtrict Command of the Old King and his Councell; ſo peremptorily injoyning Prince <hi>Roſicles</hi> to diſſolve the Treaty: and with all ſpeed to returne to <hi>Candy.</hi> Yet her Compaſſion became counterpoiz'd by a late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred affection. For being now in every particular ſatisfied of <hi>Roſicles</hi> gallant deportment: and that He was guiltleſs of what ſhe moſt ſuſpected; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy in the dereliction of his Miſtreſs, ſhe begun to feel a glowing warmth in her own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, ſo as, what ſhe commiſerated in another, ſhe became ſenſible of, in a repreſentative view of her own Condition.</p>
            <p>Theſe Impreſſions grew ſo firmly fixt in her virgin affections, as love, to whoſe Name, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and definition ſhe was ſo lately a Novice; was now entertain'd as her neareſt and deareſt Conſort. She diſclaim'd all diſtance now with <hi>Roſicles;</hi> in whoſe preſence though ſhe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd her tongue a Silence; ſhe had aſpired to that perfection in her Progreſs of Fancy, as ſhe had Speaking Eyes: which any Intelligible Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, had he been never ſo weakly diſciplin'd in the Service of a Miſtreſs, might upon the very firſt reflection have eaſily apprehended. So as his ſuit will admit no long demur: His Perſon and abilities being ſo well approv'd: his Family every way correſponding to her Choice. Wiſely then, leſt ſome ſmiſter occurrent, as ſhe had read of before, might obſtruct her intended choice; ſhe applied herſelf to her Mother-Queen (for her
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170382:51"/> noble victorious Father had been not long before diſpatcht by a deſperate Aſſaſſine) imparting freely to her, the affection ſhe bare to Prince <hi>Roſicles.</hi>

               </gap>undry Diviſions both at home &amp; abroad: the Furie whereof, as ſhe wiſely thought, might be more ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably compoſed and attempered by this uſeful al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance. So as upon a very ſhort debate, being much quickned by the Queen-Mother, who might gather her Daughters heat by her own youthfull temper: a marriage betwixt theſe two illuſtrious Princes was by the Councel of State condeſcended to; though by a Contingency of high Conſequence, Prince <hi>Roſicles</hi> was call'd home, before theſe Eſpouſals could be, as was intended, perſonally ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Which was within few weekes after So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly performed by <hi>Proxie:</hi> and the Lady ſafely tranſported to <hi>Verdo:</hi> and there received with all ſtate and royall magnificence: From whence ſhe was conducted by the Eminentſt Perſons of the whole Nation to <hi>Thamopolis:</hi> where ſhe was with much joy and indeerment entertained by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicles.</hi> But very ſoon after, thoſe Feſtivall Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities which were to accompany theſe Nuptialls, became upon this occaſion unexpectedly abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>The old King <hi>Baſilius</hi> keeping his Court then at <hi>Sibalt;</hi> fell ſick unto death: whereof diverſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports were diſperſed: and being ſudden, begot more jealouſies. Some were of opinion that his

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and that his crazy and unhealthful body being not onely ſated but much inflamed with luſcious Fare and ſweet Wines, too ſtrong for his declining Conſtitution, had begot in him ſuch hydropick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, with other contingent infirmities, as they ſhortned his daies. Though Others, and ſome of thoſe, Experienc'd Phyſitians and Philoſophers, would not ſtick to ſay expreſly, that this good old King died of Poyſon. Which they conſtantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, ſhould manifeſtly appear by ſundry im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable arguments, if the State would give way to a diſcuſſion and diſcovery of it. And <hi>Silures,</hi> One who all his time had been an intimate Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to <hi>Baſilius;</hi> (and upon that ſcore more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull then Imagination may reach to,) became publickly accuſed and impeached before a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene of State, as a principall Inſtrument of this Regicide. Which accuſations, though too full of preſumption, were within few daies wholly ſuppreſſed by the eſpeciall grace and Favour of Prince <hi>Roſicles</hi> (which was ſtrangly interpreted by many:) ſuch was the temporary Felicity of <hi>Silu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> as he became a ſucceſſive Favorite to two Princes. But highly odious to all humanity, if an Agent in his death, whoſe immerited affection raiſed him to that height. But whether the grounds of his accuſations were juſt or no, we ſhall not here determin. They are left to an higher ſcrutiny, whoſe judiciall eyes cannot be deluded; nor by favour diſſwaded; nor Feare deterred; nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corrupted; nor any by-reſpect diverted. To whoſe doom we leave him, to ſtand or fall.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:170382:52"/>
            <p>But to return you, by way of Digreſſion, a ſtrait &amp; impartial ſurvey of this <hi>Baſilius,</hi> as we ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him a rare Lapidary, whoſe Cabinet ſtored with al variety, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not render one ſtone that admits a diſcernible flaw in it: ſo might we juſtly conclude of Old <hi>Baſilius;</hi> who, though he were enricht with ſundry excellent parts ſuitable to his princely qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: and which, no doubt, might merit imitation by his Poſterity: yet there might be diſcovered ſome unbecoming blemiſhes highly derogating from the Splendor of thoſe Parts wherewith he was ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and Dignity of that Place whereto he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. And to omit the reſt, by inſtancing in one more remarkable then any of the reſt; you may collect by what has been formerly obſerved of his infinite affection to Favorites, that it leſſened that eſteem in the opinion of his People, eſpecially of thoſe who ſate near the Sternage of the State, which his endowments, embelliſhed with a native humility, otherwiſe deſerved.</p>
            <p>Now, amongſt others of his Boſom-Minions, who partak't freely of his bounty (being a Perſon of a large heart, though a remiſs Spirit) there was one <hi>Tremoſes</hi> an <hi>Illirian</hi> born, and of an uncourtly demean; wholly moulded to the rude condition and Education of his Mountainous Countrey; yet of an amiable aſpect, and comely perſonage; whom the Prince was pleaſed to receive princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally into his favour: and to confer great honours and revenues upon him. But neither the height nor heat of his deſires became ſo bounded. For in that Royal Court where this eminent Favorite was highly graced, it happened that one <hi>Polygama,</hi> a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170382:53"/> Lady of incomparable beauty and brave preſence ſet her love upon him. But there was a main impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to thwart her deſign: For her deſires ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at nothing more then to be married to him: which ſhe could not lawfully do, being long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eſpouſed to a Perſon of noble Extraction: and ſome years after perſonally imployed in the Senats Service. But what may not affection, be it never ſo illegally grounded, ſpeedily effect, being ſeconded by powerful aſſiſtance; which <hi>Tremoſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Which Confeſſion ſo perplexed the <hi>Count,</hi> as it forſlowed his reſolution in proceeding any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Quarrell. For betaking himſelf to a private Retire; the onely aſſiſtance He all his time after contributed to his unfortunate Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, were pious Prayers and loyall wiſhes: holding his breach in ſo high an Intereſt to be a dangerous <hi>Omen</hi> to his future Succeſs.</p>
            <p>Many Fields were fought; much Civile blood ſhed; Families in themſelves divided: Father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Son: and Sonne againſt Father ingaged. Nought but Fire and Fury: yet ſuch was their Folly, as none knew well what they fought for.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Roſicles,</hi> being of a malleable and eaſie temper, rather inclined to the height of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, to his great diſadvantage; without any oppoſition at all to the Proceedings of his Diet: concluding ever in this calme and compoſed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170382:56"/> 
               <hi>That all ſuch Proceedings whereto he addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his courſe, cloſed in this peaceable period; and confined their purſuit to this Point. The defence of the Law of the Land, Of the Liberty and Property of the Subject, regulated by that line and Rule of Juſtice; by which thoſe Preceeding Princes of</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>for many Succeſſions had mannaged and prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly governed their affaires.</hi> Nay, to imprint the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per belief in his diſtaſted Synod; who with light attention gave eare to his Proteſts, freely and in a full Aſſembly He invoked the Superiour Powers for witneſſes (a rare and unuſuall atteſt in <hi>Candy,</hi> a people no leſs nice in making their vows, then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in performing them;) <hi>How his onely Care and Induſtry was to defend and protect the Liberty of the Subject, the Law of the Kingdom, His Regall juſt Rights, and his Honour, much more precious then life, as He affirmed. Neither was it, (as He in the preſence of thoſe Select Statiſts declared) in the power of any perſons to encline Him to take Arms againſt his native Subjects, nor miſerably to imbroil the Iſland in Civil wars: and that his Carriage all along had given ſufficient evidence to the world how much his Affections had abhorred, and his heart bled at the apprehenſion of a Civil war.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whereto tended all this? Their previous reſolution had obſtructed attention. They could not Find hearts to believe: where they could find none to love.</p>
            <p>Loialty appeares ever an attentive hearer; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Sedition proves an indocile Scholar. Lectures of Morall diſcipline or legall obedience are of hard digeſtion to ſuch fiery ſpirits. It is true; The
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170382:57"/> Law is the ſafeguard; The Cuſtody of all private Intereſts; Perſonall Honours, Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates are all in the keeping of the Law; without this, no Soveraignty; no Propriety; every man hath a like right to any thing.</p>
            <p>Yet this Law ſo neceſſarily conducing to the Conſervation of all Eſtates is to be moulded after the <hi>Lesbian Rule:</hi> it is to be evenly ſquared: apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proportion'd in ſo faire and equall a diſtance: as it neither undiametrically aſcend too high; nor deſcend too low. For His <hi>Maxim</hi> in this is true, though it came from a dangerous Head-piece: <hi>If the Prerogative of the King overwhelme the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the people, it will be turned to Tyranny; If Liberty undermine the Prerogative, it will grow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Anarchy.</hi> An even hand is ever fitteſt to guide the helme of a State.

Many waies ſought unfortunate <hi>Roſicles</hi> to ingratiate himſelf with his own. As firſt, by disburdening his Subjects of thoſe heavy Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions that had been Formerly laid upon them. As likewiſe, to incourage the adventures of the Marchant; and revive Commerce, which was then at a ſtand; He ſent forth his expreſs Edict, That there ſhould be a Suſpenſion of the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Pramatica's</hi> (or reſtraint of Commerce) untill ſuch a Seaſon; purpoſely to improve traffick, and conſequently gain their affection. But Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are brought to a great ſtrait, when they muſt beg acceptance from their Subjects: and at laſt,

While ſome ſtood for an Anarchical Independency; Others for a Platonick parity, One for a democratick, another for an Ariſtocratick: others, and thoſe of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Leaders for an Oligarchick Power. Neither was it at all to be wondred, that the Members ſhould become thus diſtracted, being from their Head divided. Truth is, theſe diſtempers were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by the adverſe party to the levity of <hi>Roſicles</hi> Councill, who (as they ballanc'd them) were too light in the Skale, to debate of any conſiderable deſigne: far apter to corrupt their Prince, then to direct him in any action tending to his honour, or improvement of the Publick. Neither, indeed, to ſpeak ingenuouſly, were all his Senatours <hi>Solons;</hi> being generally perſons dedicated to pleaſure, or adhearing to <hi>ſelf-intereſt,</hi> an infection that ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignizeth too domineeringly over the world.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170382:58"/> Nay, rather contenting themſelves with a piece of a victory, without purſuing it: which redounded to their great diſadvantage, in all their Proceedings.

Sir, reflect upon your</hi> Education; <hi>you have been bred up in Arms. You cannot embrace a Fairer occaſion of reviving your practiſe in Arms: nor improving your honour: nor of gaining an eminent opinion with good men: nor of redreſſing the numerous injuries of thoſe who have inſupportably ſuffered: nor of regulating an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate Court now wholly debaucht and diſordered. Let Fame then, I beſeech you, and the bleeding Wounds of your Countrey awake you. The Senat and their Plebeians look upon you, as a marke of valour.

            <p>This perſwaſive Lecture delivered by a tongue that had a commanding influence over him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo prevalent with <hi>Bellonius,</hi> as it quickly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170382:59"/> and rouſed him from a ſecure ſleep: enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his thoughts with actions of an higher temper. Ambition now begun ſtrongly to work upon him. And in the firſt place he conſiders, and with the Conceipt of it apprehends no ſmall joy; how the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Candy,</hi> and the <hi>Plebeians</hi> had made choice of him, from the ſingular opinion they retein'd of his valour and martial experience: How he was likewiſe to receive the Title of <hi>General:</hi> a ſtile of incomparable honour.</p>
            <p>You may ſuppoſe him then going on with all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity to his Charge. Where with far more Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage he enters the Field, then with diſcipline to manage a Camp. Though infinitely proſperous he became in all his Exploits: wonderfully hazardous in all, but inauſpicious in none: as fortune uſually favours (to make uſe of the Proverbe) thoſe men, to whom the gifts of Nature are moſt ſparingly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. Nor, indeed, for perſonall action could the whole State of <hi>Candy</hi> make choice of a more reſolute Commander: nor one more eagerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the vading ſhadow of honour: Being One (to returne him his true Character) wholly for <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> nothing for <hi>deſigne.</hi> Which prov'd well with ſome (and thoſe the Principalleſt Inſtruments in that Service) who ſtood at diſtance with danger, making uſe of <hi>Bellonius</hi> Forwardneſſe, as the <hi>Fox</hi> did of the <hi>Cats</hi> paw in the Apothegme: making bold with the help of her Foot to pull out the Cheſſenut from the Embers. An excellent poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick way, to ſecure their perſons from peril: and yet to ſhare with the activeſt ſpirit in the Fame of the Conqueſt. On ſtill goes <hi>Bellonius</hi> ſucceſſively
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170382:60"/> in all his adventures: deſiring nothing more then to Cope with Actions of difficulty, which it was his happineſs to atchieve proſperouſly, with the generall applauſe of the Army.</p>
            <p>And what may ſeem more remarkable: Though it was his uſe, eſpecially in doubtfull occurrences, to appear ever in the Van: ſuffering no Souldier under his Command, to be more perſonally ingag'd then himſelf, nor more expoſed to apparent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: yet came He never off wounded, ſaving Once, in all thoſe deſperate Encounters.</p>
            <p>Having brought on this Great work of the Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beians to ſuch unexpected ſucceſs: his Lady <hi>Vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> after a due and ſerious diſcuſſion of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Brawls; begun wiſely to recollect her ſelf, with the approching Miſeries of her diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſtreſſed Countrey. And amidſt thoſe thoughts, falling upon a deep reſentment of the Princes ſad overtures, and the juſtneſs of his Cauſe, which ſhe never before fully apprehended, ſhe highly repented, that her perſwaſion ſhould ever produce that injurious effect; by exciting her Husband to an undertaking ſo unjuſtifiable: and to her judgment, being now reclaim'd from her Former errour, moſt irregular to the Courſe of Juſtice. Upon her due recollection of theſe, ſhe expoſtulated the Cauſe with her ſelf in this ſort.</p>
            <p>How now <hi>Verona!</hi> was it not ſufficient for thee to connive at thoſe grievous indignities done to thy Prince, unfortunate <hi>Roſicles;</hi> but thou muſt additionally inlarge them with thy injurious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions? Say <hi>Verona,</hi> did ever thy wronged Prince merit this at thine hand? Thou pretended
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170382:60"/> the redreſs of a State: but what relief may this deluded People hope to derive from theſe diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and Tragicall Events? Has our perplexed State (then which none more happy, if it could have conceipted its own happineſs) chang'd her Face for a better Complexion: or taken this ſtrong Phyſick to purge her Body of crude and corrupt humours: and conſequently inable or enliven her Conſtitution? No; it is rather to be feared; by ſending forth one ſeditious Legion, we have redoubled the number, and brought more in. <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo's</hi> Temple is diſhonoured, <hi>Diana's</hi> impiouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned; their ancient Rites and Ceremonies ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly contemned: or ſhamefully abuſed. And wereas we pretended to expulſe a Tyrant; heavens grant, that this pretenſive excluſion of One, introduce not a Multitude. Well, <hi>Verona;</hi> let not the occaſionall Source of theſe menacing miſchiefs ariſe from thy breaſt. Thou haſt done more then enough already; redeem this injury by appeaſing the Storme. Thy tongue drew <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius</hi> into the Field; be it thy endeavour to call him back with thy pen.</p>
            <p>Neither did ſhe foreſlow her reſolution: For without more ado, deſirous to undo, what her too raſh advice had induced him to undertake, with an ingenuous retraction of her former incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ſo unjuſt a deſign, ſhe addreſſed her requeſt to <hi>Bellonius</hi> being then highly ingaged in the State-ſervice, in this manner.</p>

True it is; though one Swallow make not Summer; yet one mans Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer makes many Swallows: as might appear by the Plebeian Party. Which (and in this obſerve the gratitude of vulgar ſpirits) though they had nearly acquited the end of their deſires by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous atchievments of their late retired Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; yet upon dereliction of his Charge (neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as he pretended, by the indiſpoſition of his Body) they made no better account of him, then a Caſhiered Souldier: all his exploits were quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; the memory of his forepaſt actions razed; ſo juſtly was his valour in a Service of diſloyalty requited.

            <p>This <hi>Bellonius</hi> having one onely Daughter, and inveſted in great poſſeſſions; deſired much to match her with a Perſon of deſcent, merit and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. <hi>Verona</hi> his imperious Lady, whoſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtood lately more for <hi>Roſicles</hi> then the <hi>Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Party;</hi> freely diſcovered her thoughts to <hi>Bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius;</hi>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170382:62"/> the Houſe of <hi>Silures</hi> that eminent Favorite. Who, though He had all along ſided with <hi>Roſicles:</hi> yet upon ſome private, and as was ſuppoſed, unworthy ſervice, by Intelligence or ſome other treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Office done unto the Synod, purpoſely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate himſelf with the enemy, being then grown the far ſtronger Party, as an Inſtrument to their ſide, though not much uſefull, He was by vote recall'd from Exile whereto his Fortunes had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him: and permitted to returne home, and for a ſeaſon to enjoy his own. Now <hi>Bellonius,</hi> who oppoſed his <hi>Verona</hi> in nothing, eaſily inclined to her Propoſalls. And by private Agents, powerful enough as he thought, to accompliſh ſo equall a requeſt, He ſollicited the <hi>Councill-Board</hi> for their aſſent. Which he did by <hi>Verona's</hi> advice, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all inconveniences. For <hi>Bambuca</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted an Enemy to the State (though privately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled) it could not be held ſafe to enter upon any ſuch terms with him without their approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which in all reaſon could not ſeem other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then a feaſible Condition. But ſo ſtrangely was his ſuit ſleighted; as their late ingratiated Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, was by Command peremptorily injoyned, upon penalty of life, within ſuch a time, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Territories of <hi>Candy:</hi> and to returne to the place of his Exile; with confiſcation of all his Eſtate to be diſpoſed of by the Publick. So <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gella</hi> became deprived of the Object of her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and He by this ſuit expoſed to a worſe Condition. A faire Reward for ſo long and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous a ſervice.</p>
            <p>Albeit, when leaſt expected, theſe Articles of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170382:63"/> Marriage by <hi>Verona's</hi> inſtancy were not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived: but this Match privately ſolemnized; to the great diſguſt of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>State:</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to <hi>Climenes,</hi> who ſitting at the <hi>Sterne,</hi> could not in policy reliſh ſuch dangerous Allyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>But in very deed, the <hi>Plebeians</hi> little needed at that time the aſſiſtance of <hi>Bellonius;</hi> Fortune breath'd proſperouſly upon their Sails. Albeit their ſleighted <hi>Generall</hi> importun'd much to know the g ounds of this repulſe: which was ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to him in theſe words: <hi>That the State could not hold it ſelf ſecure upon their aſſent of ſo ſtrong an allyance: especially in a time ſo variouſly fluctuant and unſetled.</hi> And this was all he could receive from them. <hi>Climenes, Lamachus,</hi> and <hi>Muratus</hi> were the onely men in eſteem: and ſuch as ſat at the Sterne of the State. All which, as by the long Continuance of thoſe Civile Wars, as they were grown eminent in the diſcipline of Arms, ſo to give them their diſtinct Characters, they might be properly deſcribed thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Climenes</hi> was a perſon of a piercing and ſubtile judgement. An exact Reader and diſcoverer of men. Serious and ſolid in his diſcourſe; familiar with few; ſeemingly affable to all. Much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to Intelligence, which highly improv'd his knowledg. No leſs happy then ſpeedy in diſpatch. Confident in his deſignes: and a Conſtant Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to his own Councells. He knew well by a Cunning way of pretending to make his mouth a ſtranger to his heart: having ever an open em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace to his profeſt Foe. He had got that <hi>Tiberian,</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:170382:63"/> art, or rather it was innate with him, to walk in the Clouds: and to ſhrowd his dangerouſeſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with ſmoother appearances. A man hardly to be re-gain'd, being once loſt: nor long to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd, unleſs <hi>preciouſly</hi> retain'd. An infinite Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger, if his words would ingage him: ſeeming bountifull, but naturally Cloſe-fiſted: ſo as never any pretended more by his liberality to merit a title of honour; who inlarged more the Revenues of his private Exchequer. He was ever jealous of a ſtrange Face, as he might well: for never had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more Foes without, nor Feares within: none outwardly better arm'd againſt aſſaults: nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly more naked, nor affrightfully expos'd to alarms. A religious Profeſſor; yet no Sect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to He would not adheere: and profeſs himſelf a Favourer. He was very ſuſpicious of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of any Commanders, unleſs they were of his own Election; and to his own Family in relation. So as his own Allyes were generally deſign'd to the Higheſt Commands. His Extraction was good; but Ambition deprav'd it. No Engineer on Earth more expeditely nor experimentally art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for acquiring his own ends.</p>
            <p>He was held in the opinion of men ſtout e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: and wiſe enough too in the heat and height of the Battell; as to tender the ſafety of his Honour, by a ſecure diſtancing of his Perſon from danger.</p>
            <p>It was uſuall with him to counterfet an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dreſs and expreſs in the management of his affaires; aſcribing little to himſelf or the prudent Conduct of his Forces by his direction: yet might
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170382:64"/> you eaſily collect by the <hi>Series</hi> of his diſcourſe, that the period of the Action were it never ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, pointed at him: Which he ſhadowingly ſought to diſcover, by leſſening the valour or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of the advice of ſuch as were his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues: or by ſome curſory digreſſion, impe in his own perſonall adventure to cloſe the iſſue with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his honour. It is to be confeſt by all that knew him, that none had ever more Art in delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the apprehenſions of men, by ſeeming to be what he was leaſt. Yet ſomethings he did which undiſguis'd him, by diſplaying him to the World, to be an eager purſuer after popular Fame: nay, that <hi>Ambition</hi> was his <hi>Minion</hi> amidſt all thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving pretences or dazlings of humility, which he had caſten before the eyes of undiſcerning men. Wherein, to ſpeak truth, his vaine-glory pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd his Folly.</p>
            <p>For even in Sacred Places, where the eminenſt Monuments of the ancienſt and reverendſt Statiſts were erected; he cauſed his own Statue to be reered: and from the very Materials of their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Mauſolea's irreverendly raiſed.

            <p>But in imitation of that <hi>Lacedemonian Agis,</hi> he took an excellent Courſe for calming this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: for to cure this fury, as if he had been ſtung with the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> he would forthwith call for Muſick (to which Muſical aires he was affection at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Though at laſt his diſtemper grew ſo violent: as a Jealouſie of his own ſafety made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a perpetual Priſoner to himſelf: Guards with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out could not ſecure him, when ſuch Legions of Fears did inwardly accompany him. This it was to command others, and to be a ſtranger to his own Commands.

            <p>Now for <hi>Lamachus,</hi> he was more active then deſigning. One, on whoſe eaſineſs <hi>Climenes</hi> wrought much for his own advance: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as meanly required for his affectionate ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. In the whole proceſs of thoſe Civile Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broilments, <hi>Lamachus</hi> had ever a full ſhare. No conſiderable Scene, wherein he acted not his part: and came not off with much Fame. He was of a generous winning nature: and much belov'd of the Souldery. Of whoſe affection and profeſt zeal unto him, if he had ſeaſonably made uſe; he might not onely have parallel'd <hi>Climenes;</hi> but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd an incomparable Office of piety and loyall duty to his diſtreſſed Soveraigne. Whoſe heavy condition at that time, merited more pity then it could attract Envy.</p>
            <p>And certainly his naturall diſpoſition, had it not been miſ-guided by irregular Principles, would
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170382:65"/> never have fallen upon any ſuch Extrems; being inclined to a juſt and loyall generoſity. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly He had the happineſs to have ſundry opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities offered, if they had not been by his unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs neglected, of appearing an uſefull Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for <hi>his Reſtauration,</hi> whom intentionally he ſeem'd to tender: and to commiſerate his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe ſad diſaſters had brought his unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Family to that pitch of miſery, as never were branches ſprung from ſo royall a Root ſo diſ-rent nor irreparably divided from their Originall Stemme. Which glorious action had it been timely purſued, as it was opportunely preſented; it had not onely advanced but ſetled <hi>Lamachus</hi> in ſuch a flowriſhing and ſtable Condition: as it had raiſed its Foundation above the reach of a Corrival: or the Envy of any diſloyall Malignant; to whoſe Cenſure his cleaneſt actions became afterwards ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Neither is it to be doubted, but if his more apprehenſive thoughts could have divined what hard meaſure his meriting Service was to reape from <hi>Climenes,</hi> to whom he had been ſo uſefull and ſucceſsfull a Colleague ſince the very firſt grounds of thoſe unhappy diſtractions: He would have been ſo ſenſible of his preſent Condition and future ſafety: as to Crown the Evening of his actions with an Exploit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iety. Which he might have done without much difficulty, being ſo coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by the Souldery, eſpecially at that time, when <hi>Climenes</hi> being then in purſuit of a <hi>Title</hi> which diſ-reliſhed the Army: and which all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long during that tedious Tract of a Civile war He with all his Complices had ſeriouſly and ſolemnly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170382:66"/> diſ-avowed: had begot to himſelf and his Allies a general <hi>Odium.</hi> This was an excellent occaſion, if it had been <hi>Lamachus</hi> fortune to make uſe of it: for him, after a loyal reconciliation, to have uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Forces with <hi>Roſicles,</hi> and by that happy Juncto, ſeconded by <hi>Bellonius</hi> auxiliaries, who in a retired diſcontent, had a deep reſentment of his own indignities; might have accompliſh'd the work, redounding no leſs to his honour; then his reparation and reſtitution to whom he ought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But the Fates had otherwiſe decreed.</p>
            <p>For nothing could <hi>Roſicles</hi> deſign: nor in his courſe of Warfare undertake, which ever promis'd ſucceſs; were it with never ſuch care, vigilancy or circumſpection purſued. Which we muſt leave to the ſacred-ſecret Cabinet of a ſuperiour Council; tranſcending far the inferiour light of our Intellect.</p>
            <p>For the ambition of <hi>Climenes</hi> in his purſuit of a <hi>Titular Regality</hi> had not onely diſguſted, but wholly aliened the affections of thoſe who were his <hi>Equals</hi> in the Field: beſides other perſonal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries which his uncontrouled liberty had acted: ſo as even <hi>Fania's</hi> honour, <hi>Lamachus</hi> his endeered Conſort (a Lady of approved continence) by his too much freedom, became ſuſpected: and by the aſperſive pen of a Satyrizing Pamphleter baſely tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: yet all theſe Conſequences (ſo ſiniſter was his Fate) conduced not at all to <hi>Roſicles</hi> advantage.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Lamachus,</hi> whoſe Character we here ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you; was not onely addicted from his youth to all generous Exerciſes; as Horſmanſhip, Artilery, Muſick and the like: But by the help of <hi>Pratenſis,</hi> he became an excellent Floriſt: in which ſtudy he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170382:66"/> uſed to beſtow many hours, till he had attained to an exact perfection of it. VVith <hi>Papillus</hi> too, a Country Limner he conſorted familiarly; by whoſe direction he was initiated in the pleaſant Art of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineature: wherein after his coming to <hi>Thamipolis,</hi> upon acquaintance with <hi>Perocu,</hi> and his dextrous Fancy, he became exquiſite. The Exerciſe of theſe Studies brought him to the true eſtimate of time: holding nothing more precious, then the expence of thoſe hours which conduced to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Knowledge. But to theſe Sedentary addreſſes he never ſeriouſly applied his endeavors, till the heat of thoſe wars begun to be more cool and temperate: unleſſe at ſuch ſpare and ſuccida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Minutes, as he might beſtow himſelf in theſe without diſ-advantage to his higher imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: which he ever purſued with much prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and alacrity. He was ever obſerv'd to be ſpare in the relation of his own adventures:<note place="margin">Nulla un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citia mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renda eſt ſumptu, quàm cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentiâ.</note> and had the real way, without any adulterate art, of winning affection; which he procur'd by his native affabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and uſual Clemency. The only <hi>Cement,</hi> which with leaſt Coſt both knitteth and dilateth the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of Amity.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, for his Extraction it was good: but his actions inlarged his fame. Which had climb'd to an higher Story, had he not with <hi>Medaea</hi> taken the worſer part.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Muratus;</hi> to limne him to life, he was a Piece tact up in Shreads of vain glory. Yet to do the Puffin right, he did ſuch good Service in thoſe Parts whereto he was deſigned, as he became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely proſperous in his undertakings. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170382:67"/> his Fame abroad; and in ſhort time gave him the name of <hi>Conquerour</hi> in thoſe Places where he reſided and governed.</p>

Ay me! The

What was it to dig through <hi>Athos;</hi> or level <hi>Iſthmus:</hi> or with populous Armies to drink up maine Rivers? Theſe, were they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted all in One, could not equall the leaſt Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of my <hi>Muratus.</hi> Be thine owne ſtill, for none can be like thee; nor for atchievements near thee.

O what <hi>Hectors</hi> may we expect ariſing from our Progeny; when ſuch native valour appeares in our Family!</p>
                  <p>If thou wilt believe me, my <hi>Hannibal</hi> and I was lately taken up with <hi>Hecuba's</hi> dreame: for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought I was conceiv'd of a <hi>Flaming Torch:</hi> and our Augurs here told me, that it divined a gallant victorious Birth, that ſhould make ſuch a fire in <hi>Crete,</hi> as all her frontier Aſſiſtants could not quench.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Muratus</hi> name is now grown formidable: So as, I have now made that Caeſarian Impreze mine own: I <hi>come; I ſee; I overcome.</hi> I encounter with no <hi>Remora,</hi> where ere my adventures lead me, to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate my deſigne: or divert my Conqueſt. And though <hi>Honour</hi> be mine higheſt Object; I meet with Materials to feather my Nest. I have been lately courted to forraigne undertakings: but the Intereſt of <hi>Candy</hi> hanging ſo heavily on my ſhoulders (<hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> as thou styles them) requires my perſonall atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Neither can my ſucceſsfull ſervice (then which none ever more prosperouſly continued nor at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved) expect leſs then a gratefull remuneration: otherwiſe I ſhall manifeſt it to the Higheſt in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that they have not to deal with a Perſon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther undeſerving or undiſcerning. But this is the leaſt of my feare: they dare not loſe <hi>Muratus,</hi> ſo long as they have an Enemy in the Field.</p>
                  <p>Thy Dreams divine no more then I expect. The Branches of my Military Forces have already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed the face of theſe Coaſts.

            <p>Thus have we heard how ſociably theſe two Conſorts ſuit in their humour: nothing but flaſhes of vaine-glory, as if <hi>Muratus</hi> had procur'd a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly from the hand of Fortune (of whoſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability he was not ſenſible, being puff'd up with the opinion of a continued ſucceſs) of Conquering whereſoever he came, and with whomſoever He was to encounter.

Nor the Sun-beams of his ſhady happineſs ſuffer Eclipſe: found by ſad experience the weakneſs of humane Confidence: and how fooliſh it was, to ſing a Song of Triumph before the victory.

               <hi>Roſicles,</hi> though he had ſmall cauſe to confide; yet his preſent Condition injoyn'd him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive: and to cancell the memory of his forepaſt

            <p>This unexpected offer of aſſiſtance, howſoever he were cordially affected, ſeemingly over-joy'd him. Better a weak allyance then none: though his affiance could be but very ſmall, where his late Experience had preſented to his remembrance ſuch apparent arguments of diſtruſt.</p>
            <p>But the frequency of their interceedes, with the ſeriouſneſs of their proteſts ſo wonne in upon him, as his diſpoſition, being naturally flexible and plyable to any impreſſion, begun to retaine a good Conceipt of them: and that they would by their valour (whereof they never appeared guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty redeem their diſloyalty: and ſo by degrees through their aſſiſtance, which their proteſts had confirm'd unto him, recover what he had loſt by the Fortune of war. But feeble is that relyance which is grounded on deceiving Principles; as you may gather by the ſequel of our Hiſtory: ſo conſtantly ſiniſter appeared Fortune in her purſuit of this Princes ſucceeding miſeries.</p>
            <p>The very next Spring, ſo ſoon as the ſeaſon would afford Forraigne with other neceſſary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations for a military ſervice: <hi>Roſicles</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170382:71"/> in a private diſguiſe, fearing the intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Enemies; which were in thoſe parts plenteouſly quartered, and too numerous for his weak Forces to oppoſe; from <hi>Bovado</hi> to <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon;</hi> where the <hi>Eliots,</hi> as they pretended, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely waited for his ſpeedy repaire. And upon his approach, with a ſeeming alacrity receiv'd him cheerfully: being prepar'd with men and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they made their credulous Prince believe, to go on in the work; and re-eſtate him in his own. But a Treaty was held fitting, in the firſt place, to determine the quarrell by Faire Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalls: and to decline that effuſion of blood, which might neceſſarily be occaſion'd by the ſad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of a New war. Which was without much ſollicitancy condeſcended to by the adverſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: knowing well, as they had ſubtilely wrought it, that the iſſue of this Treaty would conduce much to their advantage. For <hi>Climenes,</hi> who had the prime Oar in this adventure: and whoſe time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intelligence had ſufficiently diſcovered to him, how thoſe Perſons with whom they were to deal, ſtood affected; had got the art of ploughing with <hi>Roſicles</hi> Heyfers. His Cabinet Counſel would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no lock. Nothing ſo privately carried, which was not by <hi>Climenes</hi> artifice quickly diſcovered. Such a ſingular Privy-Counſellor, was he grown to from a Private Souldier. Short was this Treaty, but ſharp for <hi>Roſicles.</hi> So far were theſe perfidious <hi>Eliots</hi> from contributing their aſſiſtance; as to their ſurviving ignominy, they ſet a price of their betrayed Prince: expoſing him to the mercy of a profeſt Enemy. Thus became he not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170382:71"/> of his Soveraignty, but reſtrain'd by his own from humane liberty. Study his eſcape he might, but acquire it he could not: for his Deſigns were as ſoon diſcloſed as they were thought on. In this penſive plight for ſome Moneths remain'd this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Prince: none admitted him to conſort with, to whom he might impart his griefs: or by whom he might receive the leaſt dimenſion of Comfort a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the burden of ſuch preſſures.</p>
            <p>In theſe retired and reſenting hours; He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times recollected himſelf: and as one unmindful of his own Fortunes, then which none more viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly calamitous, in a pious reflection on the heavy condition of his Exil'd Lady, he would uſually vent his Paſſions; though he had none to commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerate them, nor with a diſcreet reply to allay them.</p>
            <p>O, would he often ſay, what an unhappy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort is he, who makes the Innocent a Conſort with him in his unhappineſs! was it not enough for me to ſuffer all the Extreams that Fortune by the fury of perfidious hands could inflict upon me: but I muſt make her a Sharer in my miſery, whoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ever full of honor and princely majeſty? was this the end I brought her from <hi>Ferrara,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave her; and of an illuſtrious Princeſs to make her below a Subject?

I ſhall never look ſo far below my ſelf; as to make my Servant, my Copeſmate.

            <p>Theſe were the laſt lines which the Princeſs ever receiv'd from her Captiv'd <hi>Roſicles:</hi> being ſo

            <p>Yet amidſt theſe diſtempers, He had ever ſome well-wiſhers left, who to their power ſo far as their Forces would extend to, deſiſted not from contributing their beſt aſſiſtance to his defence, with an integrious demonſtrance of their loyalty.

               <hi>Lycanthes</hi> pretending infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite zeal to this injuried Prince; but how he ſtood inwardly affected, his Cloudy and immasked thoughts knew beſt; levied a ſtrong and Formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army; and with theſe puiſſant Forces (far more numerous then orderly managed) He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the Territories of <hi>Candy:</hi> where with more confidence then valour or martiall proweſs, He marched along, but in a poſture much unſuitable to an experienc'd Souldier. For he appeared in his ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iſh and pompous Colours (like a vaine <hi>Popinjay</hi>) as if he had been going rather to a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice or May-game, then any Martiall adventure; vanting all along in this his undiſciplin'd <hi>Progreſs</hi> (for ſo might his <hi>march</hi> be truly ſtyled) of an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured victory, before he faced the Enemy. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſurely could any thing leſs have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; if ſuch Conſiderable Forces had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of a ſerious and ſucceſsfull Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: but as that wiſe Polititian well obſerved: <hi>Better it is to have an Army of Harts, with a Lyon to their Leader: then an Army of Lyons with an Hart to their Conducter:</hi> Such influence has a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170382:77"/> and reſolute Commander in the ſucceſs of his Army. Which <hi>Lycanthes</hi> found true to his bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter experience. For though his Forces were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly well prepared; yet his indiſcreet confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſuffered them to be ſo diſ-joynted and in their March ſo ſtrangely diſtanced, as they appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more like Forragers then Souldiers: more apt for booty then to attempt a victory: and in pillage they feathered their Neſts ſufficiently: making every Coaſt, where they ſo freely exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd their rapine and injurious plunder, their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Enemie. But the Event of this Battell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd them a demerited guerdon. For having met their Foe, whom <hi>Lycanthes</hi> ſo little feared; and over whom he ſo bravingly triumphed, before He became ingaged, They wholly diſcomfited him; without much reſiſtence; to <hi>Lycanthes</hi> great diſhonour, and his defeated Forces unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary ſlaughter. So as that very Place where this Victory with ſo ſmall difficulty was acquired, became ſo purpled and with diſlaughter'd Corp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſo numerouſly and confuſedly covered; as there ſcarce appeared ſufficient purprize of ground to afford them Graves. That ſmall remainder of them whoſe Fortune it was to be preſerved from the edge of the Sword: were made ſubject to as heavy a Fate: being generally ſold for Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves, and at ſo eaſie and contemptible a rate: as their value might appeare conformable to their valour: their deſpicable price, to the eſtimate of their pufillanimous proweſs.</p>
            <p>As for the reſt of his diſcattered Forces, by the ſlow Conduct of their March, and their diſtance
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170382:77"/> from the Battell, (having never approch'd the Face of the Enemy) they retreited back both with ſafety and Spoile: impoveriſhing the Countrey whereever they marched: returning to their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious Homes, no leſs full-handed then faint-hearted.</p>
            <p>Now to give you the true Character of this <hi>Lycan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes;</hi> though he were of eminent extraction; He was ever held to partake more of a diſſolute then reſolute diſpoſition; One, who could eaſily diſpence with his faith; infringe his promiſe; violate his vow: and a cunning deſigner, and diſguiſer too of his intendments for his own Intereſt. Yet was he never known in thoſe deſignes, (were they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſubtilely couched nor carried) to appeare proſperous. Neither was it thought by Thoſe, who held neareſt correſpondence with him: and ey'd his actions with the prudentſt inſpection, that his intention in this Expedition was clear or candid: but that he looked more upon himſelf, and how he might advance his own intereſt; then how to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the injuries of his diſtreſſed Prince: who remained ſtill a reſtrained perſon; deſtitute of all humane ſuccour or aſſiſtance. But thoſe high and inſcrutable Judgments of the Superiour Power, which ſtartleth thoſe who are moſt ſecure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible of their irregular Condition, though they ſeem for a while to ſleep, they ſeldom ſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>pe: as might be inſtanced to life in the Tragicall Period of this unfortunate Polititian: who cut off in the height of his ambition, was enforc'd (without the attendance of many reall or cordiall Mourners) to become a Spectacle to the World, and to perform
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170382:78"/> his laſt act upon the Scaffold: and ſacrifice his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting head on the Block. Which, though he ſought by all ſubmiſſive wayes and mercenary means to prevent: yet all his Contrivements could not operate to his ſafety.</p>
            <p>Two others of remarkable quality there were beſides himſelf, who having received the irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Sentence of death, were to die with him: which three were uſually in <hi>Candy</hi> thus diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. One a Courtier, and no Souldier. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond a Souldier, and no profeſt Courtier. The Third neither Souldier nor Courtier. Which was meant by <hi>Lycanthes;</hi> being a perſon naturally ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and uncivil: and in Martiall affaires igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p>After this great diſcomfiture; from whence ſo much was expected, and ſo little accompliſhed: the Senatual and Plebeian State continued in a flouriſhing peace; having no Aſſailants either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to oppoſe them, or publickly to invade them. For the Captive Prince was ſecur'd; and his weak Allies deterr'd from deſigning, much more from acting any thing conſiderable to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratick diſadvantage. During which Calm, or peaceable Ceſſation, the <hi>Candiots</hi> became infinitly proſperous (as their valour well merited) in ſundry conſequent adventures.</p>
            <p>For their Generaliſſimo <hi>Moccenigo</hi> burnt ten Turkiſh ſhips and fourteen Saiques; and took the Tribute of <hi>Rhodes</hi> amounting to 200000 Crowns; with the loſs of 100 of his men, and 300 wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. After which gallant exploit, he joyned with the <hi>Roman</hi> Galleys and thoſe of <hi>Malt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170382:78"/> their united Forces, invincible for their reſolution, they went jointly again to the <hi>Dardanelles,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct all ſuch Veſſels which carried proviſion to <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> and were reſolved (ſo highly were they inflam'd with the heat and purſuit of their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories) to fight the great Turkiſh Fleet, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at that time to keep their Rendevous at <hi>Scio.</hi> Such noble aſſayes with anſwerable ſucceſſe did theſe victorious Ilanders not onely attempt, but bravely to their ſurviving memory perform: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe ſhort interbreaths and intermiſſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations of Civil war. Whence it may be eaſily collected, what memorable actions and Conqueſts might have been atchieved and to the ſucceeding glory of <hi>Candy</hi> continued; by thoſe Heroick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whoſe viril veins had their blood wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted in thoſe Civil wars.</p>
            <p>Yet during this ſeeming Calme and Ceſſation from Arms, the Synodical and Plebeian Faction were not wholly acquitted of Foes nor Fears. All ſtood not well-affected to that mixt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſtate of Government. For there were ever Some (and thoſe not of the meaneſt quality, though their Feveriſh Spirits were not elevated to any publick action) who confidently expected and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly deſired, that their new-introduced Anarchy might be ſuppreſſed, and <hi>Roſicles</hi> to his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</p>
            <p>Others there were who ſtood aloof, giving aim to the Events of thoſe times: and having their Hutches well ſtored: and their Neſts well feathred at home, would not loſe a plume to preſerve their fidelity. Whereas others were caſten in a purer
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170382:79"/> and more refined Mould: ſticking not at all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to manifeſt their Loyalty. Some whereof (and thoſe of the eminenſt, and beſt diſciplin'd) were beſtow'd in Gariſons; upon neighbouring Caſtles, Cittadels, Forts and Fortreſſes, moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, offenſive and tenable. From whence they uſually made their excurſions for ſuppliance or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation; whenſoever any opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it ſelf to their advantage. And I ſhall here take occaſion to relate ſome pleaſant Paſſages, varied and interwoven with much delight (as an <hi>Alloy</hi> to our more ſerious diſcourſe:) which we ſhall return to you in a modeſt dreſs; without the leaſt touch of levity or petulant ſcurrility: for ſuch light trimming ſhould be out of requeſt and quite eſtrang'd from the native body or Contexture of an Hiſtory.</p>

               <p>IN the Continuation of theſe diviſions; there were many young Gentlemen, eſpecially ſuch as were younger Brothers, and had no other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes but the reſolution of their Spirits to rely on, who ingag'd themſelvs freely in this Service. But all Pitcht Fields being now determined; they were enforced to aſſociate and unite themſelves to ſuch as had diſpoſed their perſons, and repoſed their laſt hopes, and fortunes with whatſoever ſeem'd dear unto them in Gariſons.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:170382:79"/>
               <p>Amongſt which, there was one <hi>Acolasto</hi> (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had he his Name given him for nothing, for he was of a prodigal and profuſe humour:) and could find way to ſpend it, if his Revenues had been rais'd to an Empire. This free-bred Spark, having now ran ſo far on ſcore, as Chalk would give him no more credit; nor his Acquaintance afford him ſupplies or fuel to his boundleſſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe; he takes upon him this reſolution to take Sanctuary in one of thoſe Gariſons: the only Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuge to his exhauſted Fortunes. But finding one Obſtacle of maine and irremovable Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to his neceſſitated deſign; it was his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, but all in vain, to remove it.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Acolaſto</hi> had been privately contracted to an handſom young Damſel; one for beauty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the Pearl of her Country. Her this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal youth acquaints with his intendment: and how his preſent impoveriſh'd eſtate, being reduc'd to a forlorn Condition, would not permit him any longer repoſe nor reſide in thoſe parts. But all theſe Objections, though perſwaſive enough, would not work any impreſſion upon her youth: expreſly telling him that if he fixt upon any ſuch reſolution, he ſhould not want a Companion, for ſhe would follow him. Though at laſt, on his ſerious proteſt that he would ſojourn no longer then ſuch a time as he propoſed and limited to her, after much ſolicitancy with the ſhady hopes of his preferment, ſhe conſented to his requeſt.</p>
               <p>Streight to a Gariſon doth <hi>Acolaſto</hi> addreſs his courſe; where by ſome aſſiſting means he was not onely received, but admitted to an inferiour place,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170382:80"/> convenient enough for his ſubſiſtence, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the quality of his Commands. But the onely benefit he extracted from thence, was a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Temperance: for the Gariſon was not guilty of too much exceſs: in which form of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline had this young Souldier been ſeaſonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctrinated, he might have remain'd with his <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalia,</hi> in a ſecure plenty, without ingagement or defiance of an unknown Enemy.</p>
               <p>The prefixt time of his returne being now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd and paſt; and this amorous Damaſella hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing of him; ſaving onely of the Place of his aboad, but whether remov'd or no ſhe had not heard: and becoming infinitly impatient of his delay; reſolv'd to direct her courſe towards the Garriſon, where ſhe was inform'd <hi>Acolaſto</hi> was not onely receiv'd but preferr'd. Many pregnant reaſons were given her, to diſſwade her, from an Aſſay ſo full of danger, and prejudicial to her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: but none of theſe could evince her: nor with all the pretended Feares they could object, decline her. Her reſolution was pitcht; and the day of her perillous Progreſs immutably fixt: and that ſhe might without diſcovery go on in her Journey, ſhe took upon her a diſguiſe much below her extraction; the habit of a <hi>Pedler;</hi> with points and Laces about her neck: and all other accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations ſuitable to ſo indigent a Calling.</p>
               <p>But meane had that Commodity been, which ſuch a beauty could not put off. Along ſhe goes thus attired; taking with her <hi>Pandione</hi> an Alliance of hers (a Maid of ſingular modeſty and gracefull demeane) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170382:80"/> diſcourſe and pleaſant parlyance did theſe two amiable way-mates entertaine the time, and allay the difficulty of their Journey.</p>
               <p>O would <hi>Panthalia</hi> ſay; what, doſt thou think, <hi>Pandione,</hi> that <hi>Acolaſto</hi> will ſay, when he ſees me thus habited: how doeſt imagin, will he receive his Pedler? I cannot, replyed <hi>Pandione</hi> conceipt the Careſſes of Fancy: nor what theſe imaginary Conceptions of love may aſpire to, being ſuch ſtrange Gueſts to my virgin boſom, as to this hour they were never there admitted.</p>
               <p>But ſurely the tediouſneſs of the way, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that accompanied it might to any unbyaſſ'd judgment merit well a free and gracefull accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. I gather well by your alacrity, the ſtrength and vigour of your Fancy. Labours become Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, when the Object we aime at deligts us. What Obligations haſt thou laid on me, anſwered <hi>Panthalia;</hi> who art ſo willing to ſhare with me in this Journey, without hope of partaking with me in the like Joy? You might eaſily injoyne me to a Taske of more difficulty, might my Service facilitate your content in any meaſure. But I am much afraid, ſaid <hi>Pandione,</hi> that we have not yet paſt the Pikes; we have more emergent, if not imminent perills to encounter with: for we may heare how Souldiers are diſperſt every where; whoſe incivilities how might our weakneſs avoid, or by what meanes evade, if their unbounded and licencious Fury aſſault us? I have reſolv'd of a Cure for that Sore, replyed <hi>Panthalia.</hi> I know well, the Habit nor Profeſſion of <hi>Pedlers</hi> will not ſecure us; though it has thus far diſguis'd us from
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170382:81"/> our Natives. We will therefore change theſe Feminine Habits, to preſerve our Honours: and take more virile habiliments upon us. Heavens grant, ſaid <hi>Pandione,</hi> that I ſhame not my ſelf in that ſhape: for I am confident, I ſhall never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Their New-form'd Habits being accordingly provided; they went on in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. But they had ſcarcely drill'd on a league or two further; till they were advertiſed for certaine by a Countrey Bore, that the <hi>Garriſon</hi> whereto they ſhap'd their Courſe was ſo ſtraitly blockt up, and on each ſide ſo beleagured, as no paſſage could be admitted to it, nor Egreſs from it.</p>
               <p>Theſe unexpected News infinitly perplexed <hi>Panthalia:</hi> fearing much, as ſhe might very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conjecture, that in this purſuit after her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagured <hi>Acolaſto,</hi> ſhe had wholly loſt her labour. But being now near Night, they haſtned on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an adjoyning Village, where they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, they might receive convenient accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for their Lodging. And paſſing along hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily; for all their merry parliance was now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to ſad Scens; not far diſtant from thence; They happily incountred with an ancient Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man taking his Evening walk in a Field adjacent to his Houſe. Who ſeeing theſe two late tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhap'd Pilgrims; and deſiring to know what way they addreſt their courſe, <hi>Panthalia</hi> told him, that their occaſion lay for the next Garriſon; purpoſely to viſit a dear and intimate Ally of theirs, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170382:81"/> to accommodate him in thoſe neceſſitous times with ſome competent ſupplies.</p>
               <p>Alas, anſwered the Gentleman! I am much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid leſt your Journey prove as fruitleſs as it has been tedious, if your Addreſs did extend it ſelf to any conſiderable diſtance. No leſs remote then <hi>Landek,</hi> being neare the utmoſt Confines of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> replyed <hi>Panthalia.</hi> Too long a tract to appear effectleſs. And I ſhall freely communicate the the grounds of my Feare unto you: for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of the iſſue I ſhall leave to your own Judgments, being of ſuch neare concern to your ſelves. You ſhall know Gentlemen, that this Fort, or place of Garriſon, known commonly by the name of <hi>Pontisk,</hi> were impregnable, I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, if the beſieged had proviſion, but neceſſity muſt enforce them, were their Spirits never ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, to a ſpeedy reddition. For it is beleagured round and with ſuch aſſiduate violence aſſaulted, as it cannot be tenable long. Meane time, neither ingreſs nor regreſs is admitted: where if any one chance to be inconſiderately ſuprized; all hoſtility without mercy is inflicted on him.</p>
               <p>Be then adviſed, young Gentlemen, by One who has been ſometimes reduced to the like Straits that you are brought to; decline your ingagement upon theſe deſperate Extreams. No long time will be admitted, as the Caſe ſtands, for complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Siege. The exigent Condition of the Party beleagured is ſuch, that they muſt either yield, and timely too, or they expoſe themſelves to the Fury of an implacable Enemie: ſo ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance or hope of mercy is to be expected from the hand of Crueltie.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:170382:82"/>
               <p>This paſſionate relation wrought ſo ſtrongly on the endeered affection of <hi>Panthaliae,</hi> as her eyes were reſolv'd into rivolets of tears. Though ſhe ſhadowed her reſentment with as much art as her preſent condition, impal'd in the purprize or ſuch affliction, could poſſibly permit. But ſhe could not ſo artfully diſſemble it, but this grave Gentleman quickly apprehended it, and in a generous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion ſeemingly partakt with her in it. But to miniſter a Cordial to theſe diſpaſſionate qualmes: and allay their Sufferings, which appeared to him above expreſſion, he proceeded in the affectionate tender of his hoſpitable Entertain in this manner. Young Gentlemen, ſaid he, for your names I know not. With a modeſt interruption, replied <hi>Panthalia,</hi> my Name is <hi>Melicertes:</hi> and my Kinſmans <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippus.</hi> May you long flouriſh in the Splendor of your names and relations, ſaid he; but you muſt excuſe me, if in this commiſeration of your adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (for never could a more inopportunate time nor hazardous aſſay call you forth of your own Country) I return you my advice, diſguſtful, it may be, at the firſt view; becauſe the alacrity of your youthful Spirits may be ſuch as it will admit no impedes, but rather purſue then prevent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>No, anſwer'd <hi>Panthalia;</hi> though our deſires breath into an infinite fervour of viſiting ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deered a Friend: yet muſt we with patience give way to the extremitie of time: and with much thankfulneſs ſubmit our ſelves and our perplext af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to your prudent advice and direction. For our Condition reſts now, as thoſe who ſail in a Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170382:82"/> ballac'd with an heavy burden, but without anchor; expos'd to ſtorms, ſhelvs and every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching danger. Let me then play your Pilot; I ſhall find you Sea-room at leaſt, to ſecure you from an imminent peril. With all ſerious attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they gave ear unto him: adviſing them with much prudence and affability in this ſort, for their preſent Security. It has been your fortune, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to come to this Grange; where you may reſt confident of a free and Friendly welcom; and though not ſo accurate, as it may be, your qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I ſhall then injoyn you, out of a pious care to your welfare, and hoſpitable reſpect to the ingag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Perſons, to take your Repoſe here with me and my Familie: till theſe violent and impetuous ſtorms be over-blown.

In variety of diſcourſes a part of the night was beſtowed: and after a Free and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall repaſt, the old Gentleman ſenſible of the wearineſs of their Journey; gave direction to his daughter<note n="*" place="margin">In an Abſtract of this Romance called <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippe.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Aretina</hi> to accommodate them with all conveniences: and to lodge them in one of the beſt Rooms, ſuitable, as he imagin'd, to their condition; though in modeſty they appear'd ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170382:83"/> in diſcovery of it. By this it grew Bed-time for this ancient Gentleman; whoſe due obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of ſeaſonable hours had inlarg'd his yeares with much health and freſh vigour. And having now taken his leave of theſe two late tranſhap'd Gentlewomen, with wiſhes to their good reſt; He departed the room, recommending them to the ſerious care, dipoſure and accommodation of his daughter.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Aretina</hi> was his onely Child; One who had been often in the way of Marriage but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver miſt it. One <hi>Remora</hi> or other ſtill interpoſed the Object of her preferment. Neither were her deſires cold in the purſuance of her affection. But either her Suiters Fortunes were below or above her Condition: or the freedom of her diſpoſition ſprinkled their Suit with a diſ-reliſh: So as, ſhe was grown now as ancient in yeares, as Fervent in her deſires: and commonly diſtinguiſhed in thoſe parts by the title of the <hi>Mother of the Maids,</hi> or the <hi>Maiden-Matron;</hi> the <hi>Veſtall Virgin,</hi> or the <hi>Virgin Votareſs;</hi> or more commonly by the <hi>Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs of Cardel.</hi> But no ſuch religious nor abſtemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a votareſs, as to reject the affection of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Servant: or diſcourage the amorous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayes of any ſpritely or alacrious Gallant: being as flexible and apt to receive an impreſſion of love: as any youthfull Lover (were his proteſts never ſuch ſtrangers to his breaſt) was addreſt to tender it. You may eaſily ſuppoſe then, what a pleaſing and acceptable charge this Taske was, being ſo ſeriouſly recommended to her by her Father. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a dangerous bait; as apt to take, if it be nib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170382:83"/> at, as to be taken. This prov'd an attractive Object to <hi>Aretina.</hi> Who might diſcover in her two affectionate Gueſts ſo much native beauty; as it could not poſſibly actuate leſs then irreſiſtible flames in the boſom of Fancy: nor become leſs, if not timely oppos'd, then a dangerous Incendiary to young blood. Time, we know, is precious; and <hi>Aretina</hi> weighs the eſtimate of every graine or minute at the higheſt rate, during her Cuſtody of theſe two amiable Sojourners. And <hi>Panthalia,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd with no leſs quickneſs of Fancy in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending; then excellence of Beauty in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing; to delude her inamour'd Guardian, and ſhadow her own diſguiſe; expreſt ſo much art, as ſhe anſwer'd look with look: and with that amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous kind of reflection, as her ſmiles preſented language enough; to operate this coneipt in <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina;</hi> that ſhe was no leſs taken then her ſelf: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting their affections mutually on one Object: ſo ſtrongly did this imaginary influence act upon the enlivened thoughts of that ancient amoriſt. Theſe apprehenſions interwoven with other ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcourſe ſpinned out the night longer then theſe two wearied Pilgrims well deſired; but theſe Civilities of <hi>Aretina's</hi> attendance with other obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Treats could not mannerly permit them to diſcover their wearineſs, nor importune her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. At laſt with a pleaſant ſmile (an intelligible regret of what ſhe meant) ſhe took her leave, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to their reſt: whereof, no doubt, they partak't more fully then <hi>Aretina</hi> did: whoſe active thoughts had made ſleep a ſtranger to her eyes.</p>
               <p>Theſe two being in bed, <hi>Pandione</hi> was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170382:84"/> of <hi>Panthalia,</hi> what an opinion ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The ſable Curtains of Night were no ſooner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd: and <hi>Latona</hi> reſigned her ſhady govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but <hi>Aurora</hi> diſheviling her golden treſſes awakned love-ſick <hi>Aretina;</hi> whoſe care ſolely fixt upon her Charge (the delightfull'ſt Task th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Never was Creature upon the firſt interview more deluded, nor ſtrangely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed. All the next day, after their uſual repaſts, which were with far more curioſitie prepared and diſhed then had been formerly; they beſtow'd in Arbour-diſcourſes, with other time-beguiling Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations: and with that varietie as if ſhe had ſet her whole Family a-work to entertain theſe Stran, gers with raritie of Inventions. For her aged Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an ancient hoſpitable Houſe-keeper had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a period to all ſecular cares, and recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all the charge and proviſion of Oeconomick affairs to his Daughter, who knew well how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an hanke, and abridge that profuſeneſs of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170382:84"/> bounty, if her providence had not been over-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd by Fancy. Neither in very truth, did <hi>Pantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> whoſe education had been inured to delicacy, diſguſt this freedom of Entertain: who, though ſhe were ingag'd in purſuit of another Allay; yet had ſhe ever a reſerve for <hi>Senſe;</hi> which with much complacencie her deſires were ever ſtrongly bent to ſatisfie.</p>
               <p>When night came, they beſtow'd it no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully in other trifling pleaſures; as in making <hi>Gooſlings</hi> i'th aſhes; <hi>draw gloves, Purpoſes, Ridles</hi> and the like: wherein <hi>Panthalia</hi> had been much vers'd: and appear'd, eſpecially to <hi>Aretina,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ingenious. Neither in theſe onely, but in Exerciſes of Poeſie, to ſhrowd their Sexes effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy; they would frequently endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their pregnancy: but their Subjects were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver drawn from love in the Choice of a Miſtreſs, of ſuch like Fancy, which ſuited handſomely with <hi>Aretina's</hi> humour: and left deeper impreſſions in her affection.</p>
               <p>One day, (upon a prepared reſolution betwixt them) <hi>Panthalia</hi> with her diamond wrote in a window of her Lodging, being directly oppoſite to <hi>Aretina's</hi> Entry: and from whence ſhe uſually made her Proſpect to a delightfull Garden, neare adjoyning, theſe lines:
<q>
                     <l>That wench for me, and none but ſhee,</l>
                     <l>That's neither froward nor too free.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Pandione,</hi> to cover her ſelf with the like vaile; being in her Election for the ſame Sexe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd her in this ſort:
<q>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:170382:85"/>
                     <l>That wench, I vow, Shall be my Joy,</l>
                     <l>That's neither forward nor too coy.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aretina</hi> chancing next morning to read theſe verſes, laugh'd heartily, Alas, poor Fools, quoth ſhe! How pittifully are we weak women tax'd, to be forward, froward, coy, and what not? whereas you ſubtile men be thoſe <hi>Coy-ducks</hi> that lure us to your <hi>Nouze,</hi> and then unhappily leave us. For when you have got your deſires, they beget ſatie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and by degrees prepare freſh fuell for new Fires. Yet, truſt me, methinks Love is a pretty thing: and I could find with all my heart to love; ſo I might find One that would do the like. <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalia</hi> ſtanding at her back, preſently interrupted her, ſaying: Why, Lady, retaine you that harſh opinion of us; as if all mankinde were adulterate mettall; and no pure bulloigne amongſt us? No, replyed <hi>Aretina,</hi> I am not infected with any ſuch Criticiſme. I am confident, <hi>Melicertes,</hi> you could love, and conſtantly; if your Curious eye could once fixe on an Object that might like you. And the Object I could really fixe on, anſwer'd <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalia,</hi> (deſiring nothing more then to inwreath her ſtill in this Labyrinth of love) is very near me. Speak cordially, Sir, have your thoughts a reall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to love? Do not hold me, ſweet Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, all <hi>Cucumber:</hi> your Servant (if I may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume ſo meriting a title) has native vitall heat; affectionate deſires inabled with active Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as other Creatures have.</p>
               <p>Truſt me you make me put on complexion; no
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170382:85"/> doubt, Sir, your Conſtitution retains no Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of a Conſumption; but promiſeth more ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity in action, then reality of affection. And yet I will not judge raſhly, methinks ſuch a Feature ſhould partake as well of Conſtancy as Fancy: yes, Madam, if the Expreſſions of a Stranger were not accompted of as aery motions, you might find ſomething in <hi>Melicertes</hi> to merit your good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: ſeeing, as he may ſafely proteſt, your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deering Entertaine and obliging Favours have won ſo much ground of him; and acquir'd ſuch Command over him; as incomparable feminine beauty was the very firſt that He idoliz'd, or courted for a Miſtreſs; and that ſhe ſhould be the ſole and abſolute Object of his Choice, if it might be his happineſs to deſerve that acceptance, that ever he ment to eſpouſe of her Sexe.</p>
               <p>This infinitely tranſported <hi>Aretina;</hi> ſo as ſhe could ſcarcely containe her ſelf from ſealing her free aſſent and acquieſcence with the gage of her lips: but <hi>Pandiones</hi> haſty coming in prevented the Seal: ſo as no more of any amorous diſcourſe was admitted at that time: onely muttering with her lips, (and that with much privacy, leſt her fellow-traveller ſhould partake of this ſecreſie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently impede the hopes of her approching fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity) that ſuch a faire face Could not poſſibly harbour a falſe heart. So eaſily ſhe ſuffered her ſelf to be deluded with a meer Chymera of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>When night came, ſhe deſigned another way not onely to initiate but accompliſh the pitch of her deſires; which ſhe projected in this manner,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170382:86"/> away to proſtitute her honour for the ſpeedier in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of her pleaſure. To expedite this, ſhe gave eſpecial direction that theſe two Gueſts ſhould belodged in ſeveral rooms: and <hi>Panthalia</hi> next her own. Which done, <hi>Aretina</hi> opportunatly ſuited with the darkneſs of Night to vail the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſty of her addreſs; laid hold upon that ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable occaſion, with much ſilence to leave her own Bed: and as one fearful to lie alone, made bold to acquaint herſelf with an unexpecting Bed-fellow. <hi>Panthalia</hi> betwixt ſleeping and waking, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her to be <hi>Pandione,</hi> you keep unſeaſonable hours, Girle. Which words <hi>Aretina</hi> took to her ſelf; little thinking that <hi>Pandione</hi> could paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that notion. Meane time, <hi>Panthalia</hi> unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of her new Conſort, either ſeemingly or real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear'd, as if ſhe had recommended her ſelf, in a ſweet repoſe, to <hi>Endimions</hi> lap. Thunder could ſcarce awake her; much leſs the fruitleſs imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of an intruſive Gueſt. Nearer and nearer did <hi>Aretina,</hi> (ſo much ſoveraignty had unbounded ſence got over Reaſon) creep towards <hi>Panthalia;</hi> who at laſt as one halfe awake us'd theſe words: "Pray thee <hi>Pandione</hi> lye not ſo neare me. Alas, ſweet Soul, ſaid <hi>Aretina;</hi> what a ſtrong Conceipt has the remembrance of his beleagured Friend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in him! This <hi>Pandione,</hi> doubtleſs, is the ſame Gentleman whom they deſire ſo much to viſit. He muſt needs prove conſtant to his Miſtreſs, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo faithfull to his abſent Friend. Then with a low feigned voice, as one fearfull either to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe her quiet: or conſcious of her own bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whiſpering cloſely, She told Her, ſhe was
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170382:86"/> not <hi>Pandione</hi> but <hi>Aretina:</hi> and that her devotional affection to him, had caus'd her to diſpence with prudence and virgin continence: and that his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety would not cenſure this act, as an apparent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of impudence, but intire zeal and obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious ſervice. Neither was it the Satisfaction of a ſenſual deſire, but the happy fruition of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that had eſtrang'd her from her reſt. This was ſtrange diſſembling Rhetorick, deſerving ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be admir'd then believ'd: yet it might paſs for current, being inſtill'd into her ear, who <hi>Dulcina</hi>-like, either ſeem'd to ſleep or was aſleep: while <hi>Aretina</hi> more watchful then an <hi>Hesperian</hi> Siſter, continued her repoſe, hourly expecting a grateful requital from an hand that had no power to give it. Thus was this inamor'd Lady in all her Aſſay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> deluded; expecting more then ſhe injoy'd: by fixing the Eye of her miſ-guided fancy on an incompetible Object.</p>
               <p>By this time had <hi>Latona</hi> rendred up his Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands to the Government of <hi>Phoebus.</hi> Thoſe to ack and reſplendent beams, ſo long diſtanced from diffuſing their glory on this inferiour Orbe; as if they had infinitly deſir'd to partake of the view of ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable beauty as <hi>Panthalia's:</hi> (for <hi>Aretina's</hi> ſhe could not be a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bitious of it) peer'd ſecretly through the <hi>Cranies</hi> of her Lodging: which this vigilant <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retina</hi> obſerving lept preſently out of Bed; fearing (as ſuch light Aſſaies muſt needs foment feares) leſt <hi>Pandione</hi> or ſome of the domeſticks might come in, and diſcover her unexcuſable boldneſs. Meane time, <hi>Panthalia</hi> awaking (and whether awake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or no, it were not eaſie to be determined) and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170382:87"/> ſeeing <hi>Aretina;</hi> ſhe rais'd her ſelf a little upon her pillow, uſing theſe words: <hi>You are an early Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife,</hi> Aretina. <hi>It ſeemes you cannot keep your Bed for want of a Bed-fellow. It is as good, ſaid ſhe, for</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retina <hi>to have none, as to have a cold One. Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> knew well enough her meaning, but would neither diſcuſſe it nor diſcover it: no, nor dive too inquiſitively into it, leſt her temperance might be cenſur'd baſhfullneſs: her modeſty a naturall frigidity or imbecillity. This therefore ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly ſhadowed: ſo as, though ſhe well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that <hi>Aretina</hi> ſhewed a Countenance more averſe from her, then ſhe had formerly done; yet this abated nothing of her cheerfulneſs; preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding infinite affection to her: and upon occaſion wantonly diſporting with her: as if more virile heat appeared in her; then her approvement could apprehend.</p>
               <p>Yet it pleas'd her not a little; to obſerve with what a ſeemly and amorous dalliance <hi>Panthalia</hi> expreſt her affectionate Zeal to <hi>Aretina;</hi> which made her confident of a future contentment with more freedom: ſo irreſiſtibly had theſe aery influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences wrought upon her: ingaging her to ſundry diſpaſſionate encounters, and permitting no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to paſs by her, that might ſuitably cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with her deſires, or more clearly accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them.

                  <hi>Panthalia</hi> taking up the Paper <hi>Pandione</hi> deſir'd much to partake of the Content of it; being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, by ſundry Symptoms which ſhe diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and by which ſhe gathered, that <hi>Aretina's</hi> infirmity ſtood in need of ſome ſoveraigne Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potion: and that no Phyſitian, were his art never ſo exact, could perfect the Cure, but that eye which gave the wound: and that the onely <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon-ſalve</hi> to allay her diſtemper was in <hi>Panthalia's</hi> power, though her modeſty would make no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of it.</p>
               <p>But though <hi>Pandione</hi> was very importunate for peruſing thoſe lines; yet <hi>Panthalia</hi> would by no meanes communicate them unto her.

               <p>How ſtrangely thou talkſt, ſaid <hi>Panthalia!</hi> Muſt her free and hoſpitable Entertaine be interpreted Love? Much Civility, I muſt confeſs, there is in it: and a generous reſentment of our Condition: but this is not to bear the Notion of ſenſuall love, or any other indiſpos'd affection. Not only <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,</hi> but her whole Family has laid many Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on us both, for their numerous Favours ſo amply contributed in our greateſt Extreams.

But give me leave to enjoy my own confidence: and make my thoughts their own Secretaries: Such light and merry-conceipted Loves as theſe, if ſuch there be; may be entertain'd with indifference, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued without prejudice. Such Iſſues will not lay a Charge on the Pariſh where they are nurs'd: nor cauſe the Parents to bemoane their hard Fate, in bringing forth an untimely birth.</p>

It ſeemes, Madam, if you either want Fortunes or a Miſtreſs, you might be ſufficiently ſupplied with both.</p>
               <p>But pray you reſolve me, what receipt hold you convenient to apply to this inamour'd Creature to recover her inthralled ſenſes (for I conceipt her to be infinitly diſtracted:) for truſt me, it is far above my Cure. Let that be the leaſt of thy care; anſwered <hi>Panthalia;</hi> ſhe is not ſo deeply diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but ſhe may be timely recovered.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Tarantula</hi> or <hi>Calenture</hi> may be capable of cure; this diſcompoſure in <hi>Aretina</hi> cannot be without hope of recovery. It is but a deception of ſenſe, the worſt you can make of it: and ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Fancy (hold it if thou pleaſe for a Phrency) cannot make Art a Fool, by deſpairing of a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Well; ſaid <hi>Pandione,</hi> I ſhall wiſh your appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation may produce good effect. But I could not chuſe but ſuſpect ſomething more then ordinary, when our Lodgings were ſo ſtrangely divided: and no apparent neceſſity to induce it. But my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170382:89"/> was, the iſſue of ſuch blind love could not prove leſs then innocent, howſoever her intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were deſigned. Bare hopes were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt bi th ſhe could <hi>conceive</hi> with, or your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate embraces procure. Well, replyed <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalia,</hi> I am ſorry that any ſcattered looks ſhould fall from me, to work this effect: but her preſent cure ſhall be my conſtant care. At this very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant came in the old Gentleman her Father, which occaſionally broke off their further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: for doubtleſly had he been made privy to it; the ſtory would not have reliſhed well to his pallat: hearing his daughter ſo pittifully deluded, and his civile Hoſpitality ſo ungratefully requited. Now the News which this Gent. brought was of ſuch conſequence, as the communicating of them might well produce a twofold effect, joy and fear; which may appeare by theſe Circumſtances grounded upon his own relation, which He no leſs ſeriouſly then diſcreetly delivered in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am made acquainted this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by infallible Intelligence; and such as you may relie on: That this Caſtle, whereto you inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to addreſs your Courſe, is now upon Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to be yielded up, after ſo long Siege ſtoutly continued, and maintained: and now upon no leſs honourable terms rendred. Three days are onely aſſigned to the Party beleagured to acquit the Fort, and to depart, after that time limited, with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours diſplayed and ordinary arms, and in their march to be ſo conducted by the Enemy to the next Gariſon (which they have already made
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170382:89"/> choice of) as no violence nor incivility ſhall be done them, but ſecured, according to the Law of Arms, from all hoſtility.</p>
               <p>The former part of this relation ſounded with a cheerfull accent in the Ear of <hi>Panthalia:</hi> but the latter was accompanied with jealouſies and Fears. She delighted much to hear of the reddition of the Caſtle; hoping by that means to come to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of <hi>Acolasto:</hi> but hearing of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to another Gariſon, ſhe raiſed to her troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thoughts juſt occaſion of Fear: conjecturing, that he would march along in that remove: and out of his youthful heat, wherewith he had been infinitely tranſported, become wholly forgetful of his former obligements; which to prevent, ſhe thought it fit to expedite her addreſs: rendring firſt a fair acknowledgment to the Gentleman for his free and liberal entertainment during their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with him: reſolving withall, to go on with their adventure the next morning by time, if there intercurred no apparent Obſtacle to impede it. And with much conveniency for this deſign; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gentlemans departure from her Lodging, <hi>Aretina</hi> came opportunately in, fruitleſly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what her deſires purſued: upon whoſe approch, <hi>Panthalia</hi> in a penſive and contriſtate manner (as one much perplexed with the late meſſage) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſted her in this fort.</p>
               <p>Madam, we have now received intelligence by your Fathers relation; that we ſhall very ſhortly acquit your noble Family of two troubleſome Gueſts. A grateful acknowledgment for your nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Civilities is all the retribution that can be
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170382:90"/> expected for the preſent from our eſtrang'd condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſhall leave a deep impreſſion, with a conſtant intendment of a future gratification, whenſoever an happy o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>portunity of requital may preſent it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Upon this hint, giving a private hint to <hi>Pandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,</hi> to withdraw; ſhe proceeded in this manner: Your many immerited Favours contributed to me, Lady, have obliged me perpetually to be your Servant: but to undeceave you in one particular, I hold it a civil duty, for otherwiſe I ſhould fall into deep arreers upon the ſcore of your approved affection. The Paper which you lately ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, dictated to my thoughts an unexpected Conceipt of your favour, nay fervour of love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me. But whence derived I could not eaſily diſcover: For if from beauty (as I was never <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus</hi>-like opinion'd of it) I ſhould with <hi>Sputimius,</hi> have rather disfigured it, then ſuffer it to be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſuch dangerous and diſcompoſed effects. But your diſcretion will, no doubt, quickly order theſe diſtempers by recollecting your ſelf, and rectifying thoſe miſtakes which begot theſe eaſie errors. In reply to your lines, I made bold, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam to return a paper, and to fix it in your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber window: which if you have not already par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tak't, you may be pleaſed to peruſe. It will amply render you my condition, portraiture and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What I am, and in what capacity I may be yours: The Draught will diſcover, what my hand cannot ſo mannerly deliver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aretina</hi> with pace no leſs accelerate, then heart affectionate haſtened towards the paper,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170382:90"/> promiſing, as ſhe conceipted, ſuch ſatisfaction, as her deſires could inlarge themſelves no higher: which ſhe found expreſt in theſe lines:
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Ixion</hi> was deluded by a Cloud,</l>

                     <l>Their Virgin beauties: —If our fancies dipt</l>

                     <l>Such aery phantaſies, and leave to love.</l>
                     <l>You love me well, and ſo I wiſh you ſhould,</l>
                     <l>Although I cannot anſwer your deſire,</l>
                     <l>For ſhe you love is of another mould</l>
                     <l>Then to effect what your affects require.</l>
                     <l>Where if your erring fancy run a ſhelf,</l>
                     <l>Blame not <hi>Panthalia's</hi> beauty but your ſelf.</l>
                     <l>I am not ſame I ſeem; for if I were,</l>
                     <l>I ſhould not <hi>Acolaſto</hi> thus purſue;</l>
                     <l>Fix then your fancy in a proper Sphear;</l>
                     <l>Since I partake no more of Man then you.</l>
                     <l>For this diſguiſed Habit was put on</l>
                     <l>To ſhield mine honour, which I stand upon.</l>
                     <l>'Leave then this Love, which having once given o're,</l>
                     <l>'That Maiden lives not, who ſhall love you more.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Contents of theſe lines begot in <hi>Aretina</hi> more admiration then diſ-affection. She, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore purſued <hi>Panthalia,</hi> as a Conjugal Lover; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins now to imbrace her as a natural Siſter. Her miſtakes ſhe onely labours to apologize: which is no ſooner modeſtly preſſed, then it is freely grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Though her Sex ſeem to be changed: <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:170382:91"/> reteins an affectionate boſom for her; ready to contribute in any meaſure wherein ſhe may gratifie her, whom ſo lately in a virile habit ſhe did ſo intimately tender. Theſe friendly Offers, and unexpected Offices ſuited fitly with <hi>Pantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia's</hi> occaſions; which induced her to return this Civil regreet, as an ingenuous agnition of her continued reſpect; which ſhe infinitely fear'd, might receive a Check upon the Change of her Shape.</p>
               <p>Madam, I ſee well, no habit nor ſhape can alter the form nor impreſſive figure of your love. Your free and hoſpitable entertain has already obliged us highly: and now at our farwell, it is your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to inlarge your goodneſs higher: and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to your Civilities deeper. I muſt ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly acquaint you with my reſolves: and in theſe relie upon your aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>I am now after a long and tedious Journey to complete my addreſs. I heare by your Fathers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, how this Garriſon here adjoyning is to be diſſolved: the Caſtle rendred: and <hi>Acolaſto</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many others to be removed: and in other places of Fortification diſpoſed, as for convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie they ſhall make choice on. Now my jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is great (from that intereſt I have in <hi>Acolaſto</hi>) leſt theſe occurrencies ſhould make him forget, what his former vows and ſolemn proteſts oblige him to perform. My reſolution then is to reſume my own habit, and appeare the ſame <hi>Panthalia</hi> that I am: but a Place of retirement is my deſire: and this ſo near the Garriſon, as I may addreſs a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to <hi>Acolasto:</hi> wherein I purpoſe to inform him
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170382:91"/> with the place of my reſide: with my expectance of his returne. But the conveniencie and contiguity of this Place are equally requiſite: wherein I ſhall wholly relie upon your advice and direction.</p>
               <p>Ladie <hi>Panthalia,</hi> ſaid ſhe, for now I know your Name; there is no affectionate office wherein I ſhall appeare defective, ſo it may be uſefull or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate to your vertuous deſignes: and ſhall hold my ſelf infinitly happy in expediting them. In the firſt place then, I ſhall be ſerviceable to you both in preparing you habits according to your deſire, And for your Place of retire, there is a Recluſe not half a league diſtant from the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where you may ſecurely reſide, till you have diſpatcht your addreſs. Of what Condition is that Recluſe, ſaid <hi>Panthalia?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a Monaſtery or Votary, replyed <hi>Aretina,</hi> dedicated to <hi>Delia.</hi> Where many of our Sexe are uſually received: and after their time of Probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, united to their Society or Siſterhood. Nor need you to feare of a faire and friendly Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, for they are Perſons infinitly Civile: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to all ſuch as pretend honour to the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Society.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, theſe two being ſingularly well accommodated both for habit and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by the eſpeciall care and proviſion of <hi>Aretina;</hi> having firſt taken a ſolemn and gratefull leave of the Old Gentleman: and return'd ſome tokens as teſtimonies of their thankfulneſs, to his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; by <hi>Aretina's</hi> affectionate Conduct, they were brought on their way, till they came to a faire Proſpective Hill, not far diſtant from the Houſe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170382:92"/> where thoſe <hi>Delian</hi> Votareſſes were beſtowed. And there <hi>Aretina</hi> left them; but not without teares, you may well ſuppoſe, ſo acceptable was their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; as to be deprived of it, appeared to her more bitter then death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Having entred the Votary, they were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with all Civility by an antient Matron, the Governeſs of that Family, or rather Prioreſs of that Society. by whom they were led into a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Chappell; curiouſly adorn'd with ſundry exquiſite Statues, emblematizing <hi>Diana</hi> and her <hi>Nimphs:</hi> which were ſo to life portrayed, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could work more impreſſively upon the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the Spectator. The Pillers of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were of Porphyrite Marble. The Monuments erected within, were of Jacinth, Topaz, or Rock-Pearle; whereon were ingraven diverſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs, expreſſing much elegancy of Conceipt, to perpetuate the memory of thoſe Siſters of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety there interred.</p>
               <p>After the Survey of theſe; <hi>Panthalia</hi> ſeeming deſirous to know what Priviledges of Immunities were anciently conferred on their Society; the Governeſs related to her at large with what anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in many ſucceſſions they had been continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; by whom conferred: and with what care pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Which done, that it might appeare to theſe Strangers, that ſhe would not be a-wanting in any Civile Office, tending to the ſatisfaction of their deſires or improvement of their knowledge; She return'd her an exact Catalogue, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Concordance, containing the Rites and Ceremonies ſolemnly uſed in their Society: As
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170382:92"/> alſo after what manner the Siſters of that Family, &amp; dedicated to <hi>Delia,</hi> were received into their Houſe.</p>
               <p>You do paſſing well, Reverend Votareſs, ſaid <hi>Panthalia,</hi> in making me acquainted with the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Orders and Ceremonies of your Society; who after ſome time of Probation, may probably become One of your Family.</p>
               <p>Neither would it be any derogation to you, daughter, replyed the Governeſs, to incorporate your ſelf in our Fellowſhip: ſeeing ſundry emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons; even ſome who deſcended lineally from the loyns of Princes, have diſ-valued their ſtiles of honour; laid their diadems aſide: and confin'd themſelves within theſe walls.</p>
               <p>May I, Siſter, be ſo happy as partake of the knowledge of your Nation and Extraction?</p>
               <p>I am nationally a <hi>Candiot,</hi> anſwered <hi>Panthalia:</hi> and now on my addreſs to an affectionate Ally here remaining in your Gariſon. May you proſper in your deſigns, replied the Governeſs. But the report of your Nation puts me in mind of a ſad relation, which I have oftimes heard ſpoke of in theſe parts: and it was of the heavy and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous Condition of a Prince of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: how diſloyally he was deſerted by his own: and afterwards reſtrained of his Liberty; which his diſtreſſed Princeſs no ſooner received notice of, then ſhe relinquiſhed the world: encloiſter'd her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; making a ſingular vertue of neceſſity; in parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king more abſolute felicity in her enjoyment of an inward then outward liberty. Whence I collect, how in the extreameſt Encounters of Fortune, this private retirement within a Cloiſter, may afford
<pb facs="tcp:170382:93"/> that which the whole world cannot miniſter.</p>
               <p>It is true, Reverend Matron, ſaid <hi>Panthalia;</hi> when her exiled Condition was moſt imbittered with guſts of affliction; it was her uſe to beſtow her ſeriouſeſt hours upon devotion: But for a Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd life, which you are pleaſed to commend ſo much, her affection never ſtood for that long. Though in relation to her ſafety, ſhe might ſeem to pretend to that kind of privacy: For her diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was naturally otherwiſe biaſſed: having her Education ſo much dedicated to youth: as her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer years had ever a reſerve for the like freedom. Though this might be truely ſaid of her, that no Princeſs injoy'd more pleaſure with a conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to her honour.</p>
               <p>It has been much wondred at, replied the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs, how her Husband, never deſervingly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured for any predominant vice, ſhould ſo precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly fall from ſuch an height of Command, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo deep a gulph of miſery: ſeeing his equal tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Government was ſuch; as his facility could neither accuſe him of too much remiſſeneſs: nor his ſeverity of too much roughneſs. It was an heavy Fate for him to ſuffer, being endow'd with ſo princely temper.</p>
               <p>It has been ever the unhappy condition of moſt Countries, and with grief I ſpeak it, particularly of mine own, ſaid <hi>Panthalia;</hi> when fulneſs of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, famed by a long continuance of peace, has begot in them a ſurfet, never to be content when they were well. This have our Natives of <hi>Candy</hi> ſufficient experience of. For though they enjoyed plenty in a full meaſure; yet grew they weary
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170382:93"/> of their Condition. Either did their Soveraign diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe pretending that he did Lord it too much over them: or that his Council was corrupt or vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly affected: or their Laws and Liberties too much abridged: or their Impoſitions ſo heavy as not to be ſupported: you have heard the Fable of the <hi>Froggs.</hi> They itched after a new Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which at laſt they got; but repented them of their Change. Secure we were from Foes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and Foes within: but innovating our State, we became ſubject to both.</p>
               <p>Never was Government ſo diſtracted, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo orderly ſetled: and harmoniouſly diſpoſed. For to enumerate thoſe three bleſſings; which make every State in its Conſtitution truly happy: and in others winters, to retein a fair complexion and flouriſhing beauty; to wit, <hi>Commodity, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Tranquillity:</hi> none could be more amply bleſt in the plenary poſſeſſion nor full fruition of all theſe. For the firſt, none more rich within, nor more improv'd by Commodious traffick abroad. Our general peace, being in league with all, calm'd our Seas: making us lyable to the fear of none. Gladly did Forreign Nations commerce with us; ready to furniſh us with what we want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: as our Coaſt was in affording them Supplies of what they needed: yea, to repeat that elegant Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our Native Bard.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Candy</hi> for rich Supplies was ſuch an one,</l>
                  <l>All ſtood in need of her, and ſhe of none.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Secondly, for <hi>Liberty</hi> none more amply inlarg'd.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170382:94"/> Their Priviledges enjoy'd without reſtraint. No Servitude nor Vaſſalage permitted in ſo free a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Subject had an abſolute propriety in his own. No incroaching hand without due Cenſure durſt pretend to his intereſt. Men might ſafely without feare of a mercenary Informer communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their thoughts: and exhibite their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints if any indignities were done them in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Fame Fortunes or Perſons. No tongue could admit a priviledge to traduce: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could Greatneſs become ſuch a Subterfuge to Guiltineſs, as to give it an impunity to offend. Neither were our Laws ſuch Spider-webbs, as to give way to great Ones to break out, and to Little Ones to keep in: Being ſo equally ballanced, as neither price, prayer nor power could pervert them. Such was their free and impartiall diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice. Which neighbouring Countreys (ſo hard it was to obſerve theſe rare Preſidents) were more apt to admire then imitate: to approve, then improve their practiſe by them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for <hi>Tranquillity;</hi> neither publick nor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Eſtate could poſſibly flowriſh with more ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. No Forraigne Powers to invade: no indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Perſons at home, to purloine. No Court-Paraſite, nor State-Minion was admitted to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an injurious ſuit: if it imported an unjuſt chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, or an illegal requeſt; the Solliciter was to undergo a Mulct: or recceive a perſonal Cenſure. Neither could the fury of an Enemy ingage their ſecurity: for there was neither Guard nor Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, vnleſs there were one upon the Princes Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and that with ſuch reſervancy, as if the rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170382:94"/> of his Place had not exacted it; he could well have diſpenſt with it.</p>
               <p>It ſeems <hi>Candy,</hi> ſaid the Governeſs, became ſeaz'd of a violent Phrency. A conſtitution ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper'd, requir'd a continued Purge. Bodies Politick being ſo full of vicious humors cannot be long healthful. It is moſt true, replied <hi>Panthalia:</hi> and you collect rightly the indiſpoſition of <hi>Candy.</hi> It was a deep <hi>Surfet</hi> that firſt begot in my Country this infirmity. A Surfet of peace, which caus'd her to be more remiſs in the prudent managment of her State. For ſo long as we had Foes abroad; we could be content to love our Friends at home: but when our Coaſt became clear of Foes, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to make Foes of our Friends. We thought the yoak of one Soveraign too heavy. And in ſtead of one, we are now under the Subjection of many. Here <hi>One</hi> aſſumes to himſelf the Prerogative; while others in Competition, having equally born the heat of the day, repine at his ambition. Theſe recollect with themſelvs the dangers they have paſt: and how their valour and martial ſervice were of as high Concern in the accompliſhment of the work; as he who ſits at the Stern, and attributes the honour of the day ſolely to his own undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Which would, no doubt, beget infinite number of fractions in a State ſo weakly ſetled; if the wiſe and cautious carriage of <hi>Climenes;</hi> who from a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Souldier had rais'd himſelf to an abſolute Commander, had not made up thoſe breaches, which a diſtracted State had produc'd: wherein he declared himſelf a ſingular Artizan in the ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful purſuit of his own aſpiring intereſt, as he prov'd
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170382:95"/> that Maxim infallibly good: <q>A deſigning head was to be prefer'd before a number of active hands.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For though the imployments of others, in this mutation of Government, had been no leſs diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to <hi>Roſicles</hi> Forces then <hi>Climenes:</hi> yet it was ever his good Fortune to make uſe of a victory, and to inſtill this opinion into his Souldiers (who, indeed, became wholly his) that his diſcreet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were the onely ground of their ſucceſſe: and the reſt, meer Ciphers or Shadows made to follow him, and conſequently directed by his Light. This he carried ſo ſmoothly, as even thoſe who were his Complices could not with all their ingenuity diſcover it. For he had got into the art of inſinuating into their affections, and with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of hugging them, whereſoever he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred them. Nor was this all; for there was no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being of his relation, but he ſought privately to advance to one Place of Command or other: ſo as in very ſhort time, all conſiderable Offices were ſolely conferred upon thoſe in whom he might confide, and become his powerful Aſſiſtants, in caſe of oppoſition. Thus did his policy act for his future ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Has your diſtreſſed Prince, demanded the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs, hope of no Forreign ſuccours to relieve him? This, methinks, much concerns neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing States to reflect on. Such <hi>depoſing</hi> Preſidents dart fearfully on other Princes.</p>
               <p>Much has been expected, but weakly ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; replied <hi>Panthalia;</hi> Such Princes as might probably contribute their aſſiſtance, are at odds
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170382:95"/> amongſt themſelvs: which diſtractions fall out ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterly to his advantage. Beſides, Thoſe, on whom by affinity or alliance he might in reaſon moſt depend on, in a joynt aſſociation to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Party; profeſſe themſelvs his mortal Foes: which ſprung, indeed, from ſome unhappy <hi>Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries</hi> of his own: but the revenge falls heavy on his enfeebled Party. Onely ſome ſcattered Forces there remain of his own; as may appear by their unſucceſſive Attempts: for their exploits conduce weakly to his intereſt: and no wonder, being ſo deſtitute of the ſinews of war; as they want neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Supplies for their own relief. But I ſhall tire you with the continuation of theſe ſad occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which few States can parallel.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now return to my own addreſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, reverend Matron, though a ſtranger to you and your vertuous Society, I muſt preſume of your aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

                     <opener>
                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I verily believe that your Rules in martiall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline have eſtrang'd you from the Rules of loyall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Vows and Protests ſince you became a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, have got a dispenſation in the heart of a Lover. But know Sir, though women be of the weaker Sexe, which implies their imbecillity; they have ſo much ſenſe, as to be capable of an injury. You will ſay, perchance, this is but a ſhadowing of Fancy: and that my long Journey argued an individuall retention of affection.</p>
                     <p>Pray; Sir, ſuffer not your ſelf to be deceived: I can with as much eaſe dispence with that ſmall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of love betwixt us, as I can put off my habit. Our Contract is not ſo firm, but I may as freely dispence with it, as you with your Faith. A Field-Bed may ſuit well with a Martiall mould: But ſuch a repoſe would rot reliſh well with <hi>Panthalia's</hi> mind. Your Profeſſion proclaims your valour: may it redound to your honour; ſo as <hi>Panthalia,</hi> your unexemplarily wronged <hi>Panthalia,</hi> may be henceforth to you and your actions an everlaſting ſtranger. I have ſuffered enough; I meane not to be ſo unpittifull to my ſelf, as to inlarge ſufferings with freſh feares or inconſtant
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170382:96"/> Fancies. You may believe me, Sir, I have taken a long leave of love: it is my onely grief that ever I imboſom'd it; but it is not my Fortune alone. It has been the fate of many kind hearts, to open their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to a Viper before they knew its nature. If ever I give Entertaine to ſuch an unquiet Gueſt; it ſhall be upon ſecurer grounds, and better acquaintance then I have hitherto done. Unhappy is that woman in her Choice, whoſe levity will admit of Change; or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence with Faith.</p>
                     <p>As for this tedious addreſs which I lately under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took; have not the least thought, that it was any intentionall deſigne in me, to make this inquiry as a relative Object of Fancy: in conceipting otherwiſe, you infinitly delude your ſelf. This taske was to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce us, not unite us: wherein I remaine ſo ſatisfied, as no Argument, be it never ſo evincing, may oppoſe it: or decline my reſolution from being confirmed in it.</p>
                     <p>Private Contracts being not accompanied with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ceremoniall Obſervances and Conjugall Offices (eſpecially where juſt occaſions of difference are ſcandalouſly offered) may legally admit a dispenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now caſt your Eyes, <hi>Acolaſto,</hi> upon your own vagrant and debaucht Courſe, and it will give you matter enough to approve my reſolution. Your cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs deſertion impos'd a period to my affection. Vows and Proteſts had no power to tye you; the time of your prefixt returne neglected by you; the remainder of your Patrimony, which ſhould raiſe a Subſiſtence to a Family (if not timely prevented) aliened from you. And is your Perſon ſo valuable, as to injoyne love, where there is no poſſibility to ſubſiſt? But I ſhall not preſs your Fortunes, being depreſt enough already. I
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170382:97"/> muſt igenuouſly tell you, they are held in the Skale of knowing men (walk you never ſo obſcurely) to be ſcarcely competent for the Equipage of One, much leſſe for the ſupportance of many.

                     <p>I am informed, how after the yielding up of your Fort, and breaking up of your Siedge; you are for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving to another Garriſon: the Gods guide you; onely before your departure, let me acquaint you with my reſolve, which ſhall manifeſt my zeal more to devotion, then any humane affection: know that <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalia</hi> ſtands ſo much affected to theſe Rites, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and religious Rules of this Goddeſs <hi>Delia,</hi> in whoſe Society I here remaine, that her firm and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable reſolution, is to be united to their Order. The day of my approbation, admiſſion and initiation is deſigned, with the aſſent of our Governeſſe, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day after your receipt of theſe, and for the Place of my Inſtitution, it is ordered to be in the private Fane of <hi>Dioniſſa.</hi> Where, if you pleaſe, you may by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our Society become a witneſs of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalia's</hi> deſertion of the world, and all other ſecular intereſts: which, as it ſhall confirme my Election with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Change, ſo it may prepare your affection for a new Choice. Howſoever, let not theſe lines divert your remove. Your deſignes (as they have been ever) are maine and many. Mine reduc'd to One, the happy enjoyment of a divine Fancy.</p>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170382:98"/> of this work: intimating withall, how uſeful it would be to their Society, to have ſuch an One initiated in their Order, whoſe parts and Perſon might highly conduce to their Honour: and withall, how ſhe had upon private diſcourſe, found in her a plyableneſs that way; which ſhe would not at that time too eagerly purſue, but modeſtly ſilenc'd it, intending to make it <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines</hi> work, being more familiarly to be tranſacted by a <hi>Siſter</hi> in relation to their mutuall Society; then the Governeſſes more awfull Command. Neither could any thing occur more opportunely: for upon this very hint came in <hi>Panthalia;</hi> upon whoſe approch, after a Civile and Matron-like Salute, ſhe withdrew, giving way to <hi>Saladine</hi> to purſue the deſigne; whereto with a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alacrity She addreſſed her ſelf in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>

Neither, Madam, ſhould you find with us any ſuch Stoical or unſociable Condition; that it might beget in you a tedious or undelightful Communion. For though our incloiſter'd Walls promiſe little or nothing ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a Secular Content: we can in this retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inlarge our deſires in the fulleſt meaſure, to the freeſt injoyment of themſelvs. We have here

For how ſhould we in diſcretion languiſh in our deſires for injoyment of that which cannot fill us: or repine for the loſs of that; from which the Courſe of Time muſt neceſſarily divide us?

For that was long before gone a wooll-gathering: though it was my deſire, in this eager purſuit of love, to protract time, purpoſely to diſcover, whereto the youthfull Cariere of his licentious Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy would arrive, and in what period it would cloſe.</q>
               </p>

               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:170382:101"/>
               <p>
                  <q>Active Youth cannot chuſe but beget love: whereas a ſober and remiſs Civility dulls the edge of Fancy.</q>

                  <q>But thanks to the Superiour Powers for my arrival here; I am now wholly drawn off from all ſuch light thoughts, as formerly neſtled in my Virgin boſom. For as the irregularity of his Courſe gave me ſmall hope of his recovery: ſo the recollection of my Succeeding Fortune, poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the freedom of my preſent condition, has made mine heart an Alien to the indiſcreet entertainment of any ſuch youthful Fancy.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>Though I muſt tell you, Siſter, ſo fervorous were my deſires in the purſuit of his Happineſs; as I ſhall ever wiſh him well, and hold it one of my prime earthly felicities, to hear him ſucceed proſperouſly in the world, with the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his indangered reputation, and gallant deportment in military affairs: all which, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture management of his actions (being no leſs then his Perſon promiſeth) may hereafter deſerve.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>No doubt, Siſter <hi>Saladine,</hi> but you have read ſo much Philoſophy, as may ſufficiently informe your judgement, and revive your knowledge in the Myſteries of Love: the Diſcipline whereof, (though the Devotional retirement of your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick life has made you a Stranger to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of it,) has long ſince diſcovered to your Reading the nature and quality of that influence.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170382:102"/> It will tell you what powerful effects it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth: how it can tranſanimate the Spirit of the Lover to the Boſom of the Object beloved. It can unite two hearts in One, and by an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual juncture, incorporate two diſtinct Bodies in one Mind. Neither ſhould I have ſo eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd with theſe imaginary Fancies; had not my happy admittance into your regular Society, brought me to a more ſenſible apprehenſion of my former condition, by diſ-reliſhing thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Potions or <hi>Circean</hi> Impoſtures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the folly of my youth, had inthrall'd me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>May we then, replied <hi>Saladine,</hi> derive theſe hopes from you; that you will become one of us: and inrowle your ſelf in our Family?</p>

               <p>This will be pleaſant news to our Governeſs, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd <hi>Saladine;</hi> For none ever of late yeares came to our Foundation, to be admitted, who was more generally indeered, or by our Commandreſs more highly valued.</p>

               </p>
               <p>While theſe two lately adopted Siſters were bandying Civilities in this manner One with the Other; Their Governeſs came unexpectedly in; deſirous, as it might be probably gathered, what good effect <hi>Saladines</hi> advice to <hi>Panthalia</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd: or what hope ſhe might entertaine in the reception of ſo promiſing and acceptable a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But <hi>Saladine,</hi> rejoycing much in her ſucceſs; and quickning her addreſs unto her: told her, how ſhe had made way for inlarging her Foundation. What do you meane, ſaid the Governeſs? Our Foundation holds correſpondence with our Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. So we may preſerve it to Poſterity: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich it with a vertuous Family, we ſhall hold it ſufficiently inlarged: theſe Cyens of piety are thoſe large-ſpreading branches that ſhall beſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it, and with their cheerfull umbrage ſafelieſt ſecure it.</p>
               <p>Madam, ſaid <hi>Saladine,</hi> you have here one hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full branch more to beautifie your Family: and we here preſent her to your diſcreet government: and pointing to <hi>Panthalia;</hi> the Governeſs, as One
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170382:103"/> ſurprized with incredible joy, embraced her: Saying, none could be more welcome to their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: and propoſing <hi>Saladine</hi> to be her Bed-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; as one ſuiting beſt with her diſpoſition; She requeſted <hi>Panthalia</hi> to make choice of what day She pleaſed for her initiation and reception into their Order: which we intend, ſaid ſhe, ſhall be obſerved with that ſolemnity, as our due honor to a Stranger, ſhall expreſs what content we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in the injoyment of ſo abſolute a Siſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Panthalia,</hi> ſeemingly tranſported with the joy of this Election; was not ſo forgetfull of her Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as not to remember the prefixt day mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in her Letter to <hi>Acolaſto:</hi> which, though She could not be confident of the iſſue, whereto her intendments were addreſſed; her Care accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with much Secrecy, ſo fitly prepared; as the grounds of her deſigne promiſed faire, howſoever the event might ſecond it.</p>
               <p>The very ſame day therefore was appointed for performing theſe Ceremonies, which She had in her Letter formerly expreſſed.</p>
               <p>Meane time, none could appear more Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant nor morigerous to the Orders of the Houſe, then <hi>Panthalia;</hi> but the Courſe of her Probation was but ſhort: for the day of <hi>Acolaſto's</hi> remove from his Garriſon, and the approaching time of her dedication, would not permit the expence of many hours.</p>
               <p>And much had She to think upon, before this pregnant birth, being but as yet in it's <hi>Embrio,</hi> could be brought to perfection. For ſuch was the promptneſs of her Conceipt, as ſhe lov'd to ſhew
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170382:103"/> wit in the greateſt extrems: and to intangle the expectance with ſmooth deceptions: as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the iſſue of this Narration.</p>
               <p>The modeſty of <hi>Pandione</hi> her Fellow-traveller, declined her from intereſſing her ſelf in this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy: yet could not their private and aſſiduate Conference free her from jealouſie. Some ſtrange thing, as ſhe ſuggeſted to her ſelf, was in mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when She deſired much to partake. Till now at laſt her opinion became confirm'd, by what ſhe had caſually over-heard: for by playing the Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Eve-dropper, ſhe came to a diſcovery of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalia's</hi> reſolvs: and how her long and tedious Journey had diverted that aime, whereto it was addreſt, by taking a long farewell of love, and confining her Travaile, which ſhe had ſo patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indur'd, to the Walls of a Sanctuary. This though ſhe could hardly believe (for as yet ſhe had found no ſuch mortified affections in <hi>Pantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi>) yet reflecting upon her neare relation to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaſto,</hi> ſhe intended to try further. So as, having ſo faire an opportunity offered her as <hi>Panthalia's</hi> privacy; with much modeſty and winning ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, She accoſted her after this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam, I perceive by your late and unexpected reſoves, though Civility, as well beſeem'd me, would not allow me ſo much boldneſs as to inſinuate my ſelf into the Knowledge of them, how your Monaſtick Zeal has turn'd love out a-doore.

                  <hi>No, Lady, ſaid She; I underſtand your Fancy is of no ſuch circumference as it has been formerly. Love is now fallen off from the hinges.

               <p>In my recollection of theſe; and comparing One with the Other, I found an infinite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.

               <p>Then a Contemplative life (being what the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Powers affect) what more happy? Then an indiſpoſed Conſort (whereto even the moſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved patience cannot give acquieſcence) what more heavy?</p>
               <p>I appeal to your ſelf, <hi>Pandione,</hi> whether the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of <hi>Acolasto's</hi> diſſolute Courſe could reliſh with your Fancy! His continuance in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, before his imployment became Military, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd him ſufficiently; and can you think the Profeſſion of a Souldier ſhould make him better: or

               <p>Give me leave, Lady, replied <hi>Pandione,</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part my ſelf freely, and in ſuch manner as ſhall neither tax your Servant of preſumption, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my thoughts, which have been ever dedicated with all obſequious reality to your vertuous Commands, to fall ſhort in any expreſs that may eſſentially conduce to your honour: or may divert Calumny, which traducing Spirits are no leſs apt to diſperſe then to harbour.

But your wiſdom now after a ſmall revolution of time, has found out a new diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt affection and diſcretion. You lov'd the man, but not his levity; his perſon, but not his quality. Reſolve me, Madam, did you not know all this before we put on our diſguize? was not <hi>Acolaſto</hi> the very ſame he is, in your opinion? No, you will ſay, his Martial diſcipline has unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliz'd him for the office of Love. Oh, do not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your own judgment in this debate! <hi>Mars,</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:170382:106"/> if we may give credit unto Poetry, whoſe divine influence has ever deſcanted the beſt upon Fancy; was every way as Compleat a Courtier as a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier. A Field-bed was not his onely Repoſe. That <hi>Lemnian Ram</hi> found him more amorouſly lodg'd. When his Fury was reſolv'd to Fancy, he appear'd a Servant more ſutable for Court then Camp. But to divert from this adventitious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and return to your ſelf; did not the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of your affection wing your ſpeed towards this Garriſon? were you not then reſolv'd of his military imploiment? what then ſhould beget in you this alteration? If devotion be the ground, it beſtows on love the more grace: but if a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of devotion make the Fruits of love abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, it will prove a diſguize rather to delude, then improve your profeſſion.</p>
               <p>But certainly this Matrons advice has produc'd ſome ſtrange operation in your declining affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! And what ſiniſter effects may probably ariſe from thence; you apprehend not. This may enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven your Fancie with an interiour Flame: and make you wholly forgetful of your errand: mean time you conſider not the perplext condition of your deſerted Friend: who cannot chuſe but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at your inconſtancie; when ſuch experimental tokens of your ſetled and immutable love had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd you his. A decreaſe or eaſie falling off from a pen-feathred affection, being weakly grounded and tenderly imp'd, may be without much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty diſpenc'd withall. It never reteined ſuch heat as to operate in the heart: nor act diſtempers in the brain. Whereas the continuance of your
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170382:107"/> Fancy has aſpir'd to more maturity. You were pleas'd to relinquiſh many, and thoſe of eminent qualitie, to injoy him: and ſhall a ſhadow of late-pretended zeal imbelliſh'd with Veſtal Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies divide him from you? Truſt me, Madam, if ever my youth attain to that felicitie, (and who knows what the Deſtinies have decreed for me?) that I may juſtly challenge an intereſt in a deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Conſort; rather then I will diſ-ingage him whom I love, I will freely ingage my life, and expoſe my humane Being to the worſt of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams.</p>
               <p>It were great pity, ſaid <hi>Panthalia,</hi> that ſuch a tender and kind-hearted Turtle ſhould want her Mate. But who knows not that it is much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to preſcribe a Cure, then to ſubmit or give way to the Receipt. I was ſometimes as reſolute in the obliging reſpects of a Servant, as either you could be, or any Amoriſt living. But when expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience informs my judgment to life; that if my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet Fancie tranſported with the heat of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded youth, had inclined to the advice of Friends: or with an unbiaſs'd affection had evenly weighed thoſe ſad Conſequences which frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariſe from inconſiderate love: I could no way have chus'd but bluſh at my raſh Choice; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely repented in ſuffering Senſe, which periods its content in a moment of Delight, to retain ſuch a predominant hand over Reaſon.</p>
               <p>That approv'd Obſervation of wiſe Girles, who meaſure love by diſcretion, cannot be unknown unto thee <hi>Pandione: No ſooner makes Poverty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any poſſeſſion a ſeazure; then by that Forcible En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170382:107"/> it ejects love, and makes it a ſtranger.</hi> And might not this have prov'd my Caſe,<note place="margin">The beſt <hi>Choice</hi> that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits no occaſional grounds of <hi>Change.</hi>
                  </note> if I had run on in my track of Follie, by expoſing my ſelf and my deplorable. Fortunes to a remedileſs miſerie; in giving way to the Conduct of a blind and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate Fancie? Reflect upon <hi>Acolaſto's</hi> rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and profuſe exceſs; and tell me if my unhappie Choice could have expected ought leſs. O <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dione,</hi> how wiſely is that love planted, when it is diſcreetly ſeaſoned? It looks not ſo much upon a Sprigg of Roſemarie; nor the taking off a Nuptial Garter; as the mutual interchange of boſom-reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects; the fruition of real and eſſential Comforts: with a juſt proviſional care for a Poſteritie, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever time ſhall anſwer their hopes, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh their deſires in the injoyment of ſo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable a Bleſſing.</p>

Your modeſtie could once have vouchſaf'd to be taken into a Raſh-bearing: and to have broke a Cracknell or drunk a Sillibub with the youth of our Pariſh. A whole afternoons ſtory of the joyes of a Marriage life would at that time have ſeem'd ſhort. Activity was in thoſe daies preferr'd before a Patrimonie, elſe had the Image of your deſerted <hi>Acolaſto</hi> never retein'd ſuch a deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: nor injoin'd you to ſo long and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous a Journie; being an apparent argument of your immutable affection.</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:170382:108"/>
               <p>It is never too ſoon to prevent an enſuing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap (ſaid <hi>Panthalia</hi>) eſpecially in an Aſſay of ſuch high concerne; the ſucceſs whereof, if prudently entertain'd, proviſeth a continuall holy-day: but if wildly and indiſcreetly tranſacted, may admit one Marriage-day, but the ſequel a Tragick Scene without all hope of a Comicall Concluſion.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, a timely diſcuſſion of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Events might to my greater advantage have been recollected, and more ſeaſonably digeſted: but ſuch was the indiſputable fervour of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, as it hurled me head-long upon this tedious and perillous Journey. The moſt virile and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine ſpirits have not at all times their wits near them; well then may our reſolvs ariſing from the weakneſs of our Sexe, receive excuſe. Howſoever, my late alteration in the Courſe of my affection may incur a popular Cenſure, I cannot be leſs then confident, but my late hazardous Travell has ſufficiently gratified his coolneſs in the purſuit of what he ſo ſeriouſly profeſt. His Propoſall was definite; at ſuch a prefixt time to returne back from this unneceſſary Service: wherein he ingag'd his Perſon without conſtraint, or probability of preferment: But the title of a Souldier cancell'd in him the thoughts of a Lover. <hi>Acolaſto</hi> appear'd not the ſame he was. His eclips'd Fancy diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd a dificience in the ſlowneſs of his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. And am I ſo reſtrain'd in the ſtrict Rules of Love, as to be deprived of the like liberty? This were an injury to our Sexe. To have our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons managed by the ſtronger hand: to make us their Miſtreſſes no longer then at their pleaſure:
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170382:108"/> and to Caſhiere us as unſuitable Reformades in an humour.</p>
               <p>Theſe riotous Servants, who appear more prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal in their Expreſſes, then reall in performance; can artfully pretend us love, ſo long as we have the power to oppoſe our own wills; and in the unjuſteſt Commands, ſubject our ſelvs to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious intereſts. Whereas, if we ſhould at any time, even in impertinences, croſs them, how quickly would the edge of Fancy become reba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? were it not then far better to intertaine that Condition with much freedom and compoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit; wherein we may remaine ſecure from theſe domeſtick Claſhings, and injoy our Contents in a ſweet and delightfull diſcourſe, then to ingage our liberty to a Conjugall tyranny?</p>
               <p>Your late Clauſtrall Reſolvs, anſwer'd <hi>Pandione,</hi> have brought you into a ſtrange point of Hereſie. It will repent you, er'e it be long, if you continue in this erroneous opinion, that this World had a Creation; For you oppoſe the meanes of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and no People, no Society; and no So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, no World. Thus would your Monaſtick Conceipt make the World a wilderneſs: Humane Habitations Deſerts.</p>
               <p>But give me leave to tell you, that theſe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Anachorites who have divorc'd themſelves from the world, are unſociable Conſorts for thoſe that have to do in the World. They partake too much of the nature of the <hi>Ostridge</hi> to be ſuitable Friends, or amicable Companions. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of a <hi>Grave:</hi> or a diſcovery of the <hi>Elyſian-Fields</hi> (extracted from the pregnancy of Poets
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170382:109"/> brains) muſt take up the whole houre. And are theſe Subjects for young yeares, or green thoughts? why ſhould they not, replied <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalia?</hi> What inferiour ſubjects can in weight of reaſon be held comparable to thoſe which operate in the inward affections of the mind a ſetled peace? Are we not ſo long as we are here ſojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, properly reſembling light and unſteared Veſſels floating on the Maine, and by means of croſs and adverſe winds, driven from our deſigned Coaſt, or intended Harbour? Is it not then high time to prepare our ſelves againſt the encounters of ſo hazardous and tempeſtuous a voiage? Thoſe many ſtorms and menacing Shelvs which interpoſe us in this perilous Paſſage, adviſe us ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably to provide for a Convenient place of Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The life of a wiſe man is to return to God: this was the poſitive opinion of divine <hi>Plato.</hi> But how ſhould we retain in our ſelves either a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or poſſibility of returning; if we take no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in meditating of the Place, nor contemplating the delights which we are to injoy in the fruition of that Place whereto we addreſs our Courſe? It is the Conceipt of the Object, that makes our Journy eaſie: whereas our rarity in converſing with Heaven, begets a diſtance in our thoughts, and make them ſtrangers to their Country.</p>

               <p>You miſtake my meaning anſwer'd <hi>Panthalia.</hi> I profeſs my ſelf a Satyr onely to light love. When Fancy grounds it ſelf upon a phantaſtick habit, or an outlandiſh Cringe, or an affected tongue; wantonly deſcanting on a Theam of love: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not more properly compare ſuch a diſtemper'd Amoriſt, then to <hi>Pigmalions</hi> fond love and doating Complement to his marble Miſtreſs. And what joy in ſuch a formal Statue, which admits no ſuch active motion, as may either procure or deſerve affection?

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170382:110"/> Which Precept if I had ſeaſonably obſerved: my ſtraying ſteps might have been better directed; my raſh affections more diſcreetly managed, and no occaſional motive of diſcontent to thy ſelf mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, in relation to thy long and weariſom Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: nor no ground of repentance to my glowing youth in admitting, and too credulouſly inclining to the eaſie proteſts of ſo light a Suiter.

It is an happineſs ſometimes to have erred; eſpecially where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of our Error calls us home to a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our ſelvs, and an acknowledgment of our Failings: For by this means, we become not onely wiſer in the apprehenſion, but much happier in deſertion of that Error which we formerly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not argue with you, Madam, replied <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dione,</hi> touching the Subject of love; but leave you to your own Choice: But if the ripeneſs of youth beget not in your devotion a Change, I ſhall hold you to be of ſtrange mettal.

Compaſſion in a well-dispoſed Enemy may be eaſily procur'd; when his dying Foe with his laſt breathing words beggs a pardon: craving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, with teare-thrilling Eyes and throb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing heart then reconciliation in the cloſing period of his approaching diſſolution.

Be pleaſed then to entertaine theſe funerall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbreaths with a pious pity, though your estranged thoughts dart upon their unfortunate Author a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs ſcorne. Dying mens words ever reteine the deepeſt impreſſion: especially when we conſider how that very mouth which ſo lately uttered thoſe words ſhall be injoyned to a perpetuall ſilence, and never impart the leaſt accent or ſyllable of a word (as a meſſage from his mind) to the world any more. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt not this as a diſguiſe nor a pretenſive Colour to abuſe you: your rejected Lover ſurprized with ſuch a remedileſs diſtemper, cannot poſſibly at this time act the part of a diſſembler.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170382:115"/> upon the decoring and beautifying of theſe ritual Solemnities: but how to expedite the main work, for which theſe decent accommodations were prepared. Taking therefore this initiated Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant (<hi>Panthalia</hi> we mean) by the hand, with a graceful demean, the reſt of the <hi>Order</hi> likewiſe following her, ſhe mounted the ſtayrs leading to the Altar, where the <hi>Habit,</hi> wherewith <hi>Panthalia</hi> was to be attired, was ſhown her: which ſhe eyed with a pleaſing and graceful aſpect, as if no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent could be more acceptable to her. Here the Governeſs took occaſion to addreſs her diſcourſe to <hi>Panthalia</hi> with much cheerfulneſs; aſſuring her that ſhe could never diſburſe honour with more alacrity to any <hi>Votareſs</hi> entring that Society; which expreſſive favour coming from the mouth of ſo Reverend a Guardineſs, <hi>Panthalia</hi> gratefully requited with all humble obeyſance; wiſhing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then that her due Obedience to her pious Commands might have the happineſs to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit her vertuous acceptance; which ſhould be ever the higheſt pitch of her deſires. Neither, indeed, howſoever her reſolvs were formerly fixed, did ſhe appear in this way of her Profeſſion, to play the Diſſembler: For remaining now half perſwaded that her deſerted Servant <hi>Acolaſto</hi> had taken his long leave of Earth; She took upon her this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution never to returne into her Native Countrey, nor to receive into her boſom the Conceipt of any new Fancy: but to bid adue to all youthfull Folly, by changing the world with a Monaſtery, and the affection of a tranſlated Friend, with the devotion of a ſequeſtred lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:170382:115"/>
               <p>By this time, had the Governeſs preſented <hi>Panthalia</hi> to One of the <hi>Sali,</hi> or Miniſters of the Ceremonies; who had formerly been vers'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and held in high eſteem, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Office of <hi>Mithras,</hi> or Chief Prieſt of the Sun: and afterwards ordained Prince Patriark to the <hi>Delian</hi> Order. Whoſe function it was, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other eſpeciall priviledges of his Place, to offer up the Votareſſe, at her initiation, to the tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or devotion of the Governeſs, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the Ceremonies uſually obſerved by that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, at the time of her dedication.</p>
               <p>And by what divine Fate, Heaven knows, even at the very inſtant when this Lady was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and into the Society received; came unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly in the late-ſeeming languiſhing <hi>Acolaſto,</hi> who by the ſafe Conduct of an intimate Friend of the Patriarks, was with much ſecreſie and ſecurity brought into the Temple; without the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of what he either intended, or deſigned.</p>
               <p>It is not to be imagined what ſtrange perplexities this unexpected ſight begot in his amazed <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalia.</hi> But her Face, the trueſt <hi>Index</hi> of the heart, by her interchange and variety of Colours, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now pale and then red diſplay'd what her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd compoſure labour'd to conceale, ſeeming to vye Colours with the Chamelion, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in the ground colour of her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Long time ſhe muſed, and as one intranſed with ſome attractive Object, gave little attention to whatſoever that Ceremoniall Miniſter delivered; which was generally obſerved by all, but eſpecially
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170382:116"/> by the Governeſs; who, as ſhe was a devout reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencer of thoſe Monaſticall Rites and Inſtitutions of her ſelf: So could ſhe not endure that any of her Order ſhould appeare remiſſe in their honour to ſuch ancient Solemnities: but with au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the Agent of theſe Ceremonies, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to his Office, took ſmall notice of ſuch divertiſements; ſo as, receiving <hi>Panthalia</hi> upon the Governeſſes preſentation, into his hand; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their accuſtomed Rites in ſuch Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations observed: with a reverend deportment he uſed theſe words unto her. Daughter we are made known to your pious intention, and with what fervor you deſire to be receiued into this religious Society: wherein there be three things which you are conſtantly to retein in memory, to inable you the better for your ſerviceable imployments in this Family. Theſe three which are ſo neceſſarily to attend you, and whoſe attendance may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh you; are Humility, Induſtry and Continency. Huminity, in obſerving the Commands of your Superiour. Induſtry, in beſtowing your time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly upon ſome uſefull endeavour. And Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenty, in admitting no diſcourſe nor ſociable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe that may detract from your Honour. Theſe three duely obſerved, Daughter, will make a Compleat Profeſſor.</p>
               <p>But now to the work of your Initiation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the Eyes of your religious Siſters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>refixed; as on ſome glorious or reſplendent light newly
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170382:116"/> created to give an additament to their inferiour reflections. To you then Daughter, as a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick <hi>Deo-dand,</hi> am I to addreſs my Speech: <hi>To whom are you pleaſed that I ſhall give you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this Gentleman,</hi> anſwer'd ſhe, <hi>for He has the greateſt interest in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This anſwer could not perplex the whole Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety more, then it tranſported <hi>Acolaſto</hi> with joy. Whoſe unexpected acceptance imparadis'd the extaſi'd thoughts of this deſerted Lover: who of an amorous Captive, was become a Princely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour. For never did Prince triumph more in the injoyment of a Soveraignty, then this late ſeeming-ſick <hi>Acolaſto</hi> did in the ſeazure of her beauty.</p>
               <p>But ſuch Nuptial meetings were not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in this Family: wherefore being excluded from the Tutelage and Devotion of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not without apparent tokens of indignation, theſe two loving Turtles with their over-joy'd Companion <hi>Pandione,</hi> were commanded to pack thence with all ſpeed, menacing them too, that if they ſtay'd above their time limited in thoſe parts; their groſs deluding of ſo ancient and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend a Society, ſhould not paſs uncenſured nor eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape with impunity. But Delay was as tedious to theſe Lovers, as it could be to their Commanders: From thence they departed with all cheerfulneſs and alacrity: albeit <hi>Panthalia,</hi> to expreſs a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Civility to the Governeſs and all her Society, took a fair and friendly Farewell of them all; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing her ſudden and unexpected alteration; with her former ingagement to <hi>Acolaſto;</hi> which
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170382:117"/> without apparent violation of Faith ſhe could no way diſpenſe with: aſſuring them withall, that if He had not taken hold of that opportunity; her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to religion had gone on, without enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining any ſucceeding Motives of Fancy.</p>
               <p>This ingenuous acknowledgment might ſeem to allay, but not wholly to cure this indignity. But their ſpeedy departure was the onely way to calm this diſtemper. Homewards therefore are we to imagine theſe two reconciled Lovers returning: mutually relating thoſe ſundry Occurrents, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, during their abſence one from the other, their ſiniſter Fortunes incountred withall. Which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred no leſs content in their way-faring relation, then Scenes of diſcontent in the penſive re-view of their former Condition. But ſubſequent joys play the office of ſpeedy Sextons in burying the memory of thoſe that were precedent. The ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of love interlaid with occurring ſtories of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light made their long Journy leſs tedious. Unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Contents are ever cloathed with the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt habits, and put on the pureſt paint. Theſe, as they are moſt real, ſo they appear ever moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. The Party cannot conceal them, for his very Countenance upon their firſt appearance make a diſcovery of them. It is a <hi>Recovery</hi> which gives the ſweeteſt <hi>ſent;</hi> theſe our Experteſt <hi>Hunters</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve: and the very like effect do all croſt Lovers apprehend in the eager Chace or Purſuit of their affection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Panthalia</hi> rejoyceth in the recovery of her <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaſto,</hi> who in her opinion was irreparably loſt: which was no leſs argument of joy to <hi>Acolaſto,</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:170382:117"/> in the re-ſeazure of her ſuſpected love: both which contents ſo ſweetly and mutually acting, equally reflected on <hi>Pandione</hi> as a main Sharer in theſe injoyments. Long it was not, till their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions thus grounded, were ceremonially confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, with the conſent and approvement of their Friends. But tranſitory joys cannot poſſibly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a perpetuity. Theſe Nuptial hony Months are oftimes mixed with much aloes: as it fared with this unfortunate Couple. For <hi>Acolaſto,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forth of a diſtaſte which he conceiv'd of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalia's</hi> Freedom; being ſuch as a moderate or unprejudicate judgment would have aſcribed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to her affability then levity. Or out of his own inconſtancy (as if he had taken a Surfet of incloſed grounds) they begun to live apart. In which unhappy diviſion, <hi>Acolasto</hi> became graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Eye of an eminent Lady, called <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> a Perſon of incomparable State and gallant preſence: but infinitely addicted to the Choice and acceptance of Compleat Favorites.</p>
               <p>This Lady above the reſt of her relations held <hi>Trimelio</hi> and <hi>Acolaſto</hi> in principal eſteem; the one being a ſingular Secretary and of an excellent Dialect: the other of a graceful and winning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean. Both conteſting in their aſſiduate Service, which ſhould appear neareſt in her thoughts. But Competitors in relation to Subjects of Love beget ever the dangerouſeſt quarrels. An infinite jealouſie chanc'd to ariſe betwixt theſe two amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Favorites, which broke forth into ſuch an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable heat, as nothing but Fire and Fury breathed from them. Fancy in dependence to a
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170382:118"/> Miſtreſs, eſpecially where Beauty has ſurprized the heart, will admit no Corrivals. <hi>Acolaſto</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf for ſome private affronts done him by <hi>Trimelio;</hi> accuſed him, and not without appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Cauſe, as was generally ſuppoſed, of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and too liberal report ſpread abroad to <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's</hi> diſhonour. The Subſtance of which report was this: <hi>That his intimacy with</hi> Morana, <hi>the great Miſtreſs of his affection, had raiſed it ſelf to that pitch, as</hi> Acolaſto <hi>was but uſed for a ſhadow to palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate her deſigns: but his familiar ſecreſie onely reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for her private Cabinet: and that his acceſs with much freedom was made feaſible to him, even to her lodging Chamber, at all hours.</hi> With ſundry other vanting expreſſions, derogating highly from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rana's</hi> honour.</p>
               <p>No ſooner came the report of theſe injurious and ungratefull aſperſions to the eare of <hi>Morana,</hi> a woman of a maſculine and vindicative nature, then ſhe became highly inraged, vowing revenge in the extreameſt meaſure; if the words which <hi>Acolaſto</hi> had atteſted upon due examination pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved true. Neither would her impatience permit delay: for the very next morning ſending for <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melio,</hi> in the preſence of <hi>Acolaſto</hi> his accuſer, ſhe accoſted him in this manner.</p>
               <p>Wherein have my Favours, <hi>Trimelio,</hi> been ſo profuſely ſcattered, as the too liberall conferment of them might juſtly redound to my diſhonour?</p>
               <p>Have I ever acted any thing ſo indiſcreetly, that might beget in me an opinion of levity: or ſo free in my expreſs, as to make you confident of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming intereſt in my affection? was it a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170382:118"/> gratefull requitall in you, to anſwer my immeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eſteem of your parts with a Calumnious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? Could your eaſie acceſs promiſe to your deluded thoughts ſuch ſucceſs; as your free ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance to a Ladies chamber could not chuſe but make you Owner of her Bed? was our affability a Signall of immodeſty? In what a miſerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be poor women ſtated, when their very Countenances muſt be cenſured; their pleaſing demeane traduced, and their ſmiles, if too freely or frequently beſtowed, injuriouſly taxed? Well, Sir, clear the poyſon of this traduce and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate mine honour, in juſtifying your fidelity to the Conviction of your Accuſer: elſe expect an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and ſpeedy revenge from the hand of incenſed <hi>Morana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trimelio,</hi> upon this unexpected regret, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came infinitly perplexed; That excellent Forme of dialect wherein he uſually flowed; was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a calme, or rather an amaz'd Silence. Not one word could he utter either in defence of his own innocence: or excuſe of his raſhneſs. At laſt recollecting himſelf with much timidity and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit He muttered forth inarticulately ſome diſ-joynted words to this effect: that man breathed not who durſt accuſe him of any ſuch Crime. Yes, replied <hi>Acolaſto,</hi> here he breaths who dares juſtifie your diſhonour done to this Lady, and will be ready upon your deniall to maintaine it with his blood. Are you my accuſer, ſaid <hi>Trimelio?</hi> No Sir, I appeale to your own Letter: your own hand will impeach you without any other Accuſer. And taking a Paper out of his Pocket: Madam, ſaid He
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170382:119"/> be pleaſed to ſhew him theſe lines: and whether he can or no remember his own Character? After She had received the Paper, and curſorily peruſed it; with a contracted countenane turning her ſelf to <hi>Trimelio;</hi> Sir, ſaid She, my queſtion ſhall be ſhort and effectuall either to cleare or impeach you; reſolve me in a word, is this your hand? I cannot deny it, anſwered <hi>Trimelio.</hi> Then muſt <hi>Marana</hi> conclude, replied She, that thou art an egregious Villain. This Letter here produced, and to one of thy Aſſociats impudently addreſſed, but by my Faithfull Servant <hi>Accolaſto's</hi> care no leſs happily then caſually intercepted, diſplays thy guilt and injoyns my revenge.</p>
               <p>All this while with a dejected Countenance <hi>Trimelio</hi> after the production of this Letter, fixing his Eyes upon the ground; remained mute, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying nothing either in defence of himſelf; nor oppoſition to his Accuſer. Which unwonted Silence (for none uſually of more volubility in Courtly Rhetorick, nor affectation of diſcourſe then <hi>Trimelio</hi>) induced <hi>Morana</hi> to conclude: that there was more modeſty in his Face then his Heart; For the one deblazon'd an apparancy of guilt by an expreſſion of ſhame; which the other fruitleſly ſought to diſguiſe: but the clearneſs of ſuch odious Crimes, which morall honeſty could not chuſe but bluſh at, might not poſſibly frame for ſuch a diſtained viſage any vizard.<note place="margin">

Being ready to teach <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> to break Rocks with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger</note> and military Conduct in the Field, as he might in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his judgement and experience, lead a Compleat Army.</p>
               <p>In a word, ſuch influence had this equall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of Love and Fear wrought upon all thoſe <hi>Iberian</hi> Forces liſted under his Command; as He might confidently aver with that no leſs affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate then reſolute <hi>African;</hi> That he was ſo dearly intereſſed and cordially poſſeſt of his Souldiers hearts; as no aſſay were it of never ſo imminent or apparent danger, which they would not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with all alacrity for his ſake. Were it to leap from a perpendicular Hill; or from any ſteep or precipitious Cliffe into the maine Sea; there was none of them from the higheſt to the loweſt, who would decline that inevitable danger, being grounded on his Commands or conducing to his honour.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:170382:121"/>
               <p>And to give one additament more to his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and proweſs; though his Prince had depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to the government of ſuch a Province; then which none more ſervile, ſavage nor cruell; yet in very ſhort time after his Plantation there, by his diſcreet and awfull management, none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more faithfull, civil nor loyall.</p>
               <p>Yet for all this bracks are found in the pureſt Cloaths. Though none in any age more loyall to his Prince, nor Faithfull to the publick State; yet was this Great Patriots Candor and Innocence ſo eagerly purſu'd by Conſular hate and popular heat, as never was any one more ſincere, and more tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: more uſefull to the State, and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully ſleighted. Sundry Articles of High Treaſon were exhibited againſt him, which were ſeconded and ſtrongly proſecuted by ſuch, who ſat at the Sterne of the State, making it their one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigne to bring them into diſgrace; who vyed with them in the management of State-affaires: or who by their abilities out-ſtript them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently more eminent in the Eye of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
               <p>The Particulars of the Charge laid againſt him were theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that he had laboured to weaken the ſtrength and ſinews of the <hi>Candian</hi> State by raiſing Commotions, and fomenting diviſions in the Frontires of their dominion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that he had infuſed poyſonous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples into the boſom of the Prince, highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Government of a Politick State: Suppreſſing by his Power (which they pretended
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170382:122"/> to be ſeconded and irreſiſtably ſtrengthned by the influence he had over his Soveraigne) all munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Laws; ancient Priviledges; liberty of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: with whatſoever neceſſarily conduced to the uniform Order or Conſtitution of a State.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He was accuſed of Extortion and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in his Courſe of Judicature (a traduce of all others moſt injurious:) for never was <hi>Ariſtides</hi> held more juſt, then he approv'd himſelf in all his Proceedings.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, of Tyranny and oppreſſion; which his ſmall increaſe of Revenue clear'd him of: For it appeared, that during all the continuation of his Provincial Government, he was much poorer than when he firſt entred it: For his Heir, a Gentleman of hopefull parts, was inforc'd after his Fathers Death, to make ſale of a great quantity of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hereditary Eſtate, to diſcharge his Debts.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, He was tax'd of being profuſely free in relation to his Honour; not only for admiring, but ſenſually purſuing ſtrange beauties: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt, of One eſpecially; who as ſhe was eſpouſed to a Perſon of Honour, ſo ſhe atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted upon her death her innocence; not only in his vindication, touching whom that infamous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was diſperſed: but likewiſe of her clearneſs and purity in defiance of all the world. To be brief, there was no Crime, that might ſtrike either at Fame, State or Life, which was not with much bitterneſs and paſſionate vehemence aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>His Proſecutors by way of Plea were <hi>Cambriano, Mardanes, Albanus,</hi> and <hi>Palmeriades.</hi> Whereof
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170382:122"/> the <hi>Laſt</hi> only ſhew'd himſelf temperate, civil and of fair deportment. For the reſt, they breath'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Fire and Faggot. Death was too eaſy a Sentence for ſuch heavy (and as they term'd them) inexpiable Crimes.</p>
               <p>But amongſt all theſe, none of his Adverſaries more impudently violent than <hi>Menippus</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio;</hi> the one for exclaiming; the other for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting what he never either ſpake or thought. Yea, rather than that malicious <hi>Nevio</hi> would give way for <hi>Sophronio's</hi> innocency to paſs with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; to make good thoſe aſſertions and ementiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous teſtimonies, which were produced and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently preſſed againſt him, He ſeconded his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations with apparent Perjury. Whereof he was convinced by Circumſtance to his great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour, if his ſeared front had been ſenſible of any ſuch blemiſh. But his inveterate hate to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phronio's</hi> perſon ſo ſtrangely tranſported him with paſſion; as the <hi>Title,</hi> which he had deſervingly ſtript him of, caus'd him to tranſgreſs the bounds of Reaſon, and in his purſuit of revenge to neglect the Cure of his wounded reputation. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn you the ſucceſs of theſe two malicious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, who ſo furiouſly run after their own quarrell; you ſhall know that vengeance dogg'd them at the heeles: and that the Supreme Powers will not ſuffer their Judgments to ſlip, though for a ſeaſon they ſuffer them to ſleep. For the One of theſe (<hi>Menippus</hi> I meane, a ſenſuall Libertine even in his age) dyed a miſerable and infamous death. And for <hi>Nevio,</hi> then whom none more hatefull, He became through his Contemptible
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170382:123"/> life, by Thoſe eſteemed leaſt, for whoſe ſervice he had been imployed moſt. A juſt Cenſure for ſuch actions of diſhonour. Which Time ſhall ſooner ſurceaſe to be, then with the File of Oblivion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aze out.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe now <hi>Sophronio,</hi> that Mirror of his time for prudence and State-policy, attached, indited and arraigned at the Bar of High Juſtice: where we are to preſent him, as his Preſence well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, bearing himſelf in a grave and diſcreet po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; ſerious and ſolid in his Anſwer: and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Article of his Charge ſo Satisfactory, as none of that Great Auditory heard him, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity ſuffered with him: and out of a generous and generall compaſſion, ſo far as their equall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions or powers could extend to, acquitted him: holding him ſo clear of whatſoever had been Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt him, as none could taxe him Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally, nor juſtly conclude him leſs then inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; unleſs his Appellants were highly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>But ſuch was the joynt vote of the Patritian Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſeconded with the aery blaſt of the vulgar; as they proceeded to his Sentence and Cenſure: imagining, as might be eaſily gathered by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent grounds, that their new Conſtitutions of State could not hold, if he ſtood up. And that it was far better for One to periſh then an Unity; though One in Him was of more worth then the whole Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Truth is, had not <hi>Sophronio</hi> been prevented by a premature and unſuſpected Surprize; Thoſe who were the principall Inſtruments of his ruine, had
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170382:123"/> fallen into his ſnare: for the Traine was laid, but the cautelous prevention of the Guilty, became deſtructive to the Innocent.</p>
               <p>It was high time then, as they thought, to take Him out of the way; and by his timely remove to lay an eaſier way to their Foundation of a new Government: ſo prompt is the braine in deſignes of blood.</p>
               <p>With a calm attention He gave eare to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death pronounced upon him; without any Change of Countenance at all. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of his, as ſome erroneouſly thought, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not from his own reſolution; but from the Confidence He had in <hi>Roſicles,</hi> his Princes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But thoſe hopes, if any ſuch were, prov'd of all others moſt failing. For though his loyall and devotionall Service had merited more from his Soveraigne, then any Subject within all his dominions: yea, though the Prince himſelf had been an Eare-witneſs of all the Articles preferred and preſſed againſt him: and in preſence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when this incomparable Statesman not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made his Reply to whatſoever was objected: but upon his juſt defence came off with honour: yea, though <hi>Roſicles</hi> in relation to <hi>Sophronio's</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence; publickly proteſted, that he could find nothing in the whole courſe of their Proceedings againſt him, which might render him culpable ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of death or defame; being ſo diſcreet and conſcientiouſly politick in the Carriage of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires during his Provinciall Government, as he might be far ſooner admir'd then imitated by thoſe that ſhould follow him. Yet for all this, ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170382:124"/> had ſome of thoſe State-Sycophants (even thoſe whoſe religious profeſſion might have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd them in better Offices) over the facile and pliable nature of <hi>Roſicles,</hi> as upon their diſcovery of the neceſſities of the time, the reſults of the Houſe, and clamours of the People, They wrought ſo ſtrongly upon him (the beſt natures are the ſooneſt deluded) as they perſwaded Him to <hi>Subſigne</hi> his death; whoſe innocence he had ſo lately atteſted. An act of high ingratitude, you will ſay, it was: and He acknowledged no leſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning this Offence, which He held piacular, in the extrems of Fortune with briny teares.</p>
               <p>And now you may imagine, that this Fury of Hate, which had ſo ſtrangely fired the hearts of the Senate, would admit no delay; it muſt break forth with a violent torrent, to the ruine of the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Warrant</hi> was no ſooner ſigned, then it was with all ſpeed tranſmitted and delivered to the <hi>Warder,</hi> in whoſe cuſtody he remain'd then under reſtraint: which came quickly (harſh news are ever impt with ſwifteſt wings) to <hi>Sophronio's</hi> hand; who was at that very time ordering his affairs, and compoſing his mind againſt all occurrents. For his better preparation wherein, he was even then read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Tract of the <hi>Tranquillity of the Mind,</hi> when this ſad Meſſage came. Which, ſmiling he entertain'd with this mild reply, after he had ſeen <hi>Roſicles</hi> Seal Manual, and ſubſcription to the Warrant: <hi>This it is to confide in the arme of fleſh, and to rely on humane levity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having peruſed the Paper, his Deſire was to be
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170382:124"/> left alone; that his privacy might allow him what the world could not afford him. Being thus left to himſelf; after a ſerious recollection of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and approaching condition; calling for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and inke, he reſolved to direct his laſt addreſſes to his vertuous Lady, in a Funerall Letter to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>

Sundry Articles, and of high quality objected, and with all Fury purſued; but nothing proved: appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring rather ſcandalous aſperſions, to impeach my Fame, and ſurprize my perſon; then grounded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations to weaken my repute or evince me of treaſon.

But this fault I impute not to Him, but to them who deluded him. It is eaſie for cunning men by their evil counſell to have strong influence over Princes Commands when their backs are at wall, and their hopes under Hatches.

                           <p>But I muſt not be long, leſt my delay might beget in you a prejudicate opinion of me touching that, which, I dare atteſt my frailty, I never had, <hi>a fear to dye.</hi> One word home-ward, and then to my laſt home.

               <p>Truth is, his Funerall Farewell ſeconded with his patient and compoſed demeane at the time of his death, begot that reſentment in thoſe who had formerly been his Mortall Enemies; as his laſt adue breathed forth with ſo graceful a paſſion, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced teares in their Eyes, who never before that time lodged remorſe in their hearts. Yea thoſe, who were the principal Agents and aſſiduateſt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of procuring his Head to be cut off; could with all their hearts have wiſh'd it on again, when they had duely conſidered, how the wiſdom of that Head, which the Hand of Faction had taken off, might have compoſed and repaired many Fractures, which the Liberty or rather Anarchy of a diſtracted State had produc'd.

A perſon held unfitting to live, becauſe he ſcorned to purchaſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil mens love. I am guilty of many crimes, if you believe my accuſers; Tyranny especially. But a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man may for pity ſake find ears to receive his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology. Here I ſtand before God and Man; where I appeal to the whole World, from whence I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; And to Heaven, whereto my hope is I am co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: That I never to this hour unſheathed my Sword to ſhed the blood of any Subject from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the loweſt. Impunity in neglect of my own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has prov'd to my ſelf a Tyranny: but my charity forgives them freely. I muſt ever bemoan the Blood of ONE, whoſe Death by inforcement, ſeconded with the perſwaſions or impoſtures rather of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Paraſites, my Hand unthankfully ſubſcribed. Never did ſubject merit more of <hi>Princes</hi> affection, and receive for his ſervice a more undeſerving guer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170382:131"/> Oh, that my tears could rinſe or raze forth the memory of ſo unhandſome an action; or expiate the guilt of ſuch a crimſon crime!</p>

               <p>But I have been dealt withal too ſhort, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue my diſcourſe long.

               <p>His Body was ſome few days after (being firſt made a Mercenary Spectacle to the people) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſolemnity at all, privately interred. Such was the immerited fall of unfortunate <hi>Roſicles.</hi>

               <p>Now it might be asked, how it could poſſibly come to paſs, that in ſo populous and confluent a City no hand ſhould be lifted up in defence of his innocence: And there is an apparancy of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it.

                  <hi>Mixendes</hi> an eminent Peer of <hi>Candy,</hi> riding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to take air in a ſtately Chariot, drawn along with ſix gallant <hi>Flander Mares,</hi> having onely <hi>Aniel,</hi> a Groom of his Chamber oppoſite to him in the end of his Chariot: The Mares ſuddenly ſtaid and would go no further, though his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioter with the help of his Poſtillion, uſed all the art and force he could to drive them forward: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which unexpected ſtand, <hi>Aniel,</hi> as one won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully amazed, ſuddenly cried out; <hi>My Lord, What Woman is that ſits there beſide you? Mixen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> though at firſt he diſcovered nothing, became ſuddenly ſenſible of the danger of this impoſture: for his Heels were preſently ſtruck up and hoiſted to the inner top of the Chariot, with his Head groveling below. Having with much difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and raiſed himſelf, by the aſſiſtance of his aſtoniſhed Groom, they joyned both together to faſten upon that apparition, which ſeemed to them a real woman, intending to pinch her; but this phantaſme, or whatſoever it might import, with a terrible flaſh of fire and hideous voice ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly vaniſhed: But not without apparent hurt to the Charioter, having his Leg broken in the very Box where he ſate, from whence he had not remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, nor uſed any agitation nor motion at all.</p>
               <p>The Poſtillion likewiſe became ſtrangely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered. The guider of the Chariot being piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully maimed, ſhortly after dyed: Whoſe body after his death, either by inchantment, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occult malady, grew as black as pitch.</p>

               <p>This <hi>Mixendes,</hi> being one in the lower liſt of the late created conſuls, was accompted by ſome to be privately an active complice of <hi>Roſicles</hi> ruine, and that this accident befel him, purpoſely to caution him of his tranſgreſſion: though others have ſince that time vindicated his honour from that aſperſion; and that it was an act of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft occaſioned upon the dereliction of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>Theſe were rare occurrences, but no way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to thoſe ſtrange prodigious birth: terrible to the eye of nature; which were produced at that time, and could preſage nothing leſs then ſome fearful unaccuſtomed alteration; whereof this amongſt many.</p>
               <p>In the Weſt part of <hi>Candy,</hi> as is reported to have hapned ſometimes upon the like occaſional mutations in the Confines of <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> a Female child was born, that from the Belly upward was a Twin, having two heads, two breaſts, and four arms; and the one part did that which the other did not: So that whileſt the one did eat, the other would not; and whileſt the one ſlept, the other waked. And having lived in this manner (as a Prodigy to Nature) for ſome certain time, the one died, the other ſurviving; which afterwards through the ſtench of the other died alſo. That which by this prodigious birth, had been formerly predicted, was by as fearful an iſſue not long after ſeconded, in production of thoſe ſtate combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereto no age was ever exemplary.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Roſicles</hi> death, the Cypreſs trees, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and Palmato's which in that Country wee

               <p>Thus by the change of one, was the ſtate of <hi>Candy</hi> quite changed; the face of the Court disfigured, and a flouriſhing government into an Anarchical condition reduced. For the ancient Peerage, whoſe deſcent and deſert might juſtly record them in the catalogue of Honour, either through diſcontent or ripeneſs of age were expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

               <p>As for that new Mintage of Nobility, extracted from the creation of <hi>Climenes;</hi> thoſe that were the graver, and in their qualification accompted wiſer; imployed their time in incroaching, and inhancing their revenues, and inlarging the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of their Mannors: Whereas the younger Fry were for undertaking Duells in defence of their Miſtreſſes. Which light skirmiſhings, being neither much fatal nor fearful, were the onely ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of their valour, as Rings, Gloves, and Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, the richeſt Trophies of their Honour, which muſh rump-gallantry ran all along in a blood for many ages together; making good that Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic all Maxim: "That the <hi>Corruption</hi> of one was the <hi>Generation</hi> of another.</p>
               <p>The nature of things, through the depravation or degeneration rather of times growing ſuch, that whereas a good man is joyned with a bad, the bad is not bettered by the good, but the good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted

                  <hi>Candiope,</hi> a Lady lineally-loyally deſcended; being both by extraction from her family, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation from her infancy ſo affected; Walking one morning early in a Grove; whereto for her private retirement ſhe uſuall frequented, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing nothing more out of the loyal fervour of her deſires, then to hear the event of that great Battail at <hi>Reus-Court,</hi> with the good ſucceſs of the Prince, whoſe reſtauration ſhe unfeignedly beſought.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170382:135"/> It was her fortune in the tract where ſhe walkt, being not far diſtant from the publick road, to meet with one in a Palmers weed, fixing his dejected eys on the ground, as if ſome ſad miſchance had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln him: or as one weary of earth, reſolving to meaſure out his Grave, and to play the Sextons part before he dyed.</p>
               <p>Long was it ere ſhe could awake him out of this his melancholy dump, or penſive amaze, ſo ſtrangely extaſied ſeemed he to be, as nothing appeared in him ſaving motion that might argue him to be living, or for the preſent capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. At laſt drawing nearer unto him. Good ſir, ſaid ſhe, what is it troubles you? What miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune has befaln you, that it ſhould have ſuch ſtrong influence over you, in writing your diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in ſuch deep Characters of ſorrow? Alas, Madam, replyed He, it were a fruitleſs diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to impart our griefs where there is no hope of remedy. My wounds, with many others, rankle too ſore to expect a preſent cure. <hi>Candiope</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by theſe words, that all things had not faln out well at <hi>Reus-Court,</hi> with much importunity therefore ſhe deſired to know of him, whether he had been perſonally ingaged in the battail or no, and what the ſucceſs thereof might be? With a deep <hi>ſcalding ſigh, we are all wholly loſt, ſaid he.</hi> Our Prince utterly routed, his hopes expired. The ſoftneſs of your Sex, and affability of your nature may retain that temper, as it may afford compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to our forlorn condition; for as yet we have hardly found it. Wo is me, anſwered <hi>Candiope,</hi> who might he be that was the Agent of this ſad
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170382:136"/> ſcene of his infilicity? The probable ground of his misfortune, replyed the Palmer, aroſe from the treachery of <hi>Leontius;</hi> a principal commander of the <hi>Scythian</hi> Cavalry, by whom, he with his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates were wholly routed. And that this diſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proceeded from <hi>Leontius</hi> treaſon might be hence conjectured; for after the battel was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he amongſt others ſurprized, his gentle uſage and eaſie confinement by the Enemy, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to all the world his ſecret treachery.</p>
               <p>But what is become, ſaid <hi>Candiope,</hi> of diſtreſſed <hi>Charicles?</hi> Of a potent Prince, replyed he, he is now made a poor Pilgrim; a fugitive deſerted of his own, and nothing but a meer ſhadow of hope to ſupport him. A weak ſupportance, Heaven knows, ſaid the Lady: Oh that I might have the honour to give him harbour; with what promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fidelity ſhould my beſt endeavours an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it? You may perchance replyed he, have the occaſion, and he the good fortune to pertake your aſſiſtance; for his hapleſs condition muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure harbour in one place or other, or we muſt conclude him loſt for ever. Mean time, Madam, I muſt ingeniouſly acquaint you, ſeeing your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſition ſteers your courſe that way, how I am become His Highneſs Almoner or neceſſitous purveyor, while he in a diſguiſed habit acts the ſad part of a diſconſolate wanderer. Thus has our condition, which formerly hath been a ſtranger to ſervile ends; or to what muſt now oblige us, beholdingneſs, injoyned us to ſubmit to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Fate; and to beg releif with ſilence, when our language cannot in modeſty find a tongue to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170382:136"/> expreſs our neceſſity. Wo is me for you, ſaid the tear-ſwoln Lady, that ever your Prince ſhould be brought to that exigence. But your pale viſage with other apparent arguments of your infeebled condition, ſtand in need, as I conceive, of more relief from a bountiful hand, then of verbal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion from a pitiful mouth. Theſe words that come from us are but airy expreſſions to waſted ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: Painted meat to a penſive Pilgrim: Be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Gentle ſir, for by what title to diſtinguiſh you, I wholly know not, to take a repaſt at my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, in this next Grange here adjoyning, where I can promiſe you ſecurity; though it may be no ſuch equipage as may any way ſuit with a perſon of your quality.</p>
               <p>This curtiſie could not otherwiſe chuſe but be received with infinite acception; to him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially and his diſtreſſed conſorts, who had not onely found neceſſary relief, but even humane pity a ſtranger to their misfortunes,</p>
               <p>As they were thus converſing, and <hi>Candiope</hi> reſolved to beſtow her care upon his accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by conducting him to her fathers houſe, (a continent repoſe for a wearied Spirit) where ſhe might not onely receive further intelligence tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Charicles</hi> condition, whoſe ſafety ſhe ſo much tendred; but afford all competent ſupplyes to this diſconſolate Palmer, as his preſent neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty required.</p>
               <p>As ſhe was, I ſay, beſtowing her whole care and ingenuous indeavours upon this Office of Piety this ſignal freedom of Hoſpitality, ſhe might hear from the skirt of the Grove a pitiful voice (a voice
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170382:137"/> well known to the Palmer, though it rendred a ſtrange accent to the ear of the Lady;) So full of paſſion appeared every expreſſion from the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of that ſorrowful perſon, as none could do leſs then commiſerate his ſad condition; upon the hearing of thoſe preſſing grounds of his complaint and perſonal reſentment. The words, as they were by him paſſionately delivered, and by her no leſs pitifully received, were theſe.</p>

                  <hi>O Heavens! When will theſe cloudy dayes cloſe with a clear evening? Muſt this black cloud hang for ever over our unfortunate houſe?

Must the fame of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily be quite razed forth of the Annals of poſterity? Is there any ſuch cloſe crime known onely to the eyes of Heaven, but ſhut from the knowledge of men; whereof our Houſe hath been highly conſcious, and as yet remains unexpiate, and conſequently the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional ground of our misfortunes? Oh, may theſe tears of an innocent Prince, rinſe the guilt of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Progenitor! for any part I appeal to the powers above whereon depend the Foundation and Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of States, if ever any act of folly ſince my infancie merited from the hand of Fortune ſuch infelicity.

               <p>Within few weeks after, being favoured with proſperous gales, they arrived ſafely in <hi>Ferrara;</hi> where we will leave him a Penſioner to the State; and recounting his misfortunes to the incloiſtered Queen his diſconſolate Mother.</p>
               <p>Thus have you heard how <hi>Charicles</hi> beyond all hope, by the private Conduct of <hi>Candiope,</hi> eſcaped the purſuit of the enemy.</p>

               <p>For what miſeries more lineally linked to one Houſe, or more ſucceſſively continued? you have heard how <hi>Baſilius,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Athalia,</hi> or as we have originally ſtyled her, <hi>Bellingeria,</hi> was ſtrangely, and not without jealouſie of his ſubjects, diſpatched; his eldeſt Son <hi>Cyrenius,</hi> a Prince of excellent hopes, not without ſuſpicion of poyſon, prematurely removed; his younger Brother <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicles,</hi> as you have heard, before the eyes of his people, the face of his eminenteſt City, and at his Court gate wofully ſlaughtered, his Son <hi>Charicles</hi> treacherouſly deſerted, diſcomfited, remaining exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; his Widow-mother incloiſtered, and the memory of that Royal Race by the Senates expreſs decree, to be quite extinguiſhed and razed out of the Catalogue of Honour, as perſons incapable of bearing any office in the Common-weal.</p>

               <p>All things now might ſeem to be quiet at home. But it is a conſtant obſervation in all States, that they remain leſs ſecure, when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to themſelves moſt ſecurity. This might be manifeſted to all <hi>Governments;</hi> but eſpecially where Uſurpation puts in for a Title. Wherein, admit there were no Heir Apparent to make his Claim, there would be a Latent Power to take revenge. So it appeared in this State-Theatre; though <hi>Candy</hi> had exiled her Foes, ſhe retained Fears. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars betwixt <hi>Climenes, Bellonius,</hi> and <hi>Lama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> reduce this diſtempered State to miſerable diſtractions. For this confuſed <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting neither wholly of <hi>Peers</hi> nor <hi>Plebeians,</hi> but of a promiſcuous Society; begun at laſt to have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of their tranſlated Government: with what felicity accompanied the harmonious union of a well-temper'd Monarchy; with the diſaſters that uſually occurred where numerous Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders burdened the State with diſtemper'd humours by their plurality. Subjects eaſily ſhake off the yoak of Soveraignty, when their Commanders be many. One or none, ſayes <hi>Caeſar.</hi> None but One, ſayes the <hi>Uſurper.</hi> None rather then One, ſayes the <hi>Leveller.</hi> Thus Government deprived of one legal-Lineal Soveraign, became wholly irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. The iſſue whereof may be clearly inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170382:140"/> in this headleſs State of <hi>Candy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellonius</hi> was a perſon (as hath been told you) of an active hand, but defective head-piece, a ſtout ſpirit, but ſhallow intellect, fitter for action then deſign: one who could do much, but ſpeak little, and of that little, ſmall to purpoſe. Infinitely ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable had he been to <hi>Climenes</hi> in all his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and incomparably proſperous in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements, being in all thoſe Civil Wars com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced againſt <hi>Roſicles</hi> and his ſucceſſor <hi>Charicles</hi> made Generall over all the State-forces, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom <hi>Climenes,</hi> during all that time, acted onely as private Commander. But <hi>Climenes</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of his weakneſs, but never till the heat of the day was paſt, apprehends a diſguſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his contracting a marriage or alliance, as he pretended, with an eminent perſon, who had held a correſpondence formerly with <hi>Charicles.</hi> This was eaſie for him to do, having by this time inſinuated himſelf into the eſteem and favour of the Army, by great rewards, full pay, and fair quarter. <hi>Bellonius</hi> recalling to mind what ſervice he had done for the Publick, ſtood for a while in reſiſtence, as a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion in defence of his honour, armed with more Fury then Patience, Proweſs then Prudence. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona</hi> his Lady extracted from a noble and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Family, incouraged him highly in theſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, aſſuring him that the memory of his exploits could not but retain a deep impreſſion in the State, and Souldiery too, with whom he had ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ingaged his perſon, and expoſed his ſafety to the deſperateſt attempts. And ſo unmindfull was the State, Senate and Souldier of his former
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170382:141"/> ingagements, and ſo indifferent for his welfare, as they left him to himſelf to ſink or ſwim.</p>
               <p>But of ſmall avail is Valour without Aſſiſtence; Price and Reward had made him incapable of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</p>
               <p>Truth is, <hi>Bellonius</hi> had formerly good opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for preſerving his Fortunes, Freedome and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and of averting that ominous fate which hung over his Family; but by neglecting it, he threw himſelf with all theſe into an inevitable precipice. His onely hope, amidſt theſe extreams, which his declining greatneſs depended on, was a New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene of the late adjourned Synod, ſummoned to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the firſt moneth of the year enſuing; the iſſue whereof, after our relation of <hi>Lamachus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſhall appear in every circumſtance to life portrayed.<note place="margin">This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman by his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and ſtudious privacy, raiſed his improvement to a high proficience in political and wiſe knowledge; which he afterwards imploy'd to his great advantage.</note> 
                  <hi>Lamachus</hi> was a Gentleman of good Extraction, great Induſtry, and ſingular Animoſity, the very right hand to <hi>Climenes</hi> in all his atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but ſiniſter to <hi>Charicles</hi> in all his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
               <p>After the brunt of theſe Wars, and much blood inhumanely ſhed, he appeared the onely man of merit and eſteem in <hi>Climenes</hi> account. No honour nor reward held ſufficient to gratifie his ſervice: Nay it was very obſervable, that <hi>Climenes,</hi> after ſuch time as his fortunes had raiſed him to the abſolute Soveraignty of an Arbitrary power: a ſtep higher then ever diſtreſſed <hi>Charicles</hi> could aſcend, and held to bear the face of a Tyrannick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, during the unfortunate reign of thoſe line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170382:141"/> deſcending Princes. After this height of his commands, I ſay, whereto his numerous victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had perch'd him, and wherewith this ſtrong alliance had irreſiſtibly ſetled him: <hi>Climenes,</hi> who partak'd no leſs of <hi>Fox</hi> then <hi>Lion,</hi> was never known to meet <hi>Lamachus</hi> without an indeered embrace, or veneration rather, as both his demean and expreſſes ſignified; ſaluting him not onely by the name of fellow Souldier, but of Prince, Champion, and Chieftain of his Army: without whoſe help, the whole fabrick of that State had ſhrunk under its own Grandeur. For he had got the art of ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping himſelf to any feature, having compaſſionate eyes to vie in tears with the Crocodile, and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Fauns to gloze with the <hi>Hyene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the ſtrength of his alliance derived from the perſons with whom he matched were theſe: <hi>Lucapius</hi> eſpouſed the eldeſt; a gallant jovial La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who in her very poſture knew how to perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate her qualified honor, and how to ingratiate an obſequious ſervant: though in the end ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an incomparable Convert; being one, to whom the diſcovery of her Fathers tyrannick actions appeared moſt odious. <hi>Fotoweldus</hi> took the ſecond; a young Foſter-mother of ſtrange o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. <hi>Seblaſius</hi> the third; a modeſt Maid, and of a compoſed carriage. The fourth and laſt was matched to <hi>Chirus;</hi> one whoſe accidental infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities had made uſeleſs for a Nuptial Bed. Theſe became additaments to his ſwelling Power; but nothing in compariſon to the influence he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his numerous Army. Upon his confidence whereof he became tranſported to ſuch unboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170382:142"/> height (an humor commonly incident to thoſe who riſe from lower grounds to mountanous for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes) as he grew infinitly apt to pick quarels at his beſt friends; being ſuch, from whom he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved formerly his ſtrongeſt aſſiſtance; and to whom he had expreſſed ſeemingly his neareſt indear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Amongſt whom, howſoever he pretended, none appeared more odious to him then his ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time boſom-friend faithfull <hi>Lamachus.</hi> Which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſt aroſe from <hi>Lamachus</hi> juſt oppoſition, and from this occaſion. <hi>Climenes</hi> arched thus with ſtrong alliance, on whom he had conferred the eminenteſt Offices and places of Command with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the whole Iſland; as likewiſe with other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Forces, underſtood ſufficiently how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now remained undone for compleating the abſolute work of his Soveraignty, whereto his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious thoughts with much politick ſecrecy aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſaving onely the Title of Regality: which though he ſeem'd outwardly to decline, there was nothing that he did more inwardly deſire. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon vote how <hi>Lamachus</hi> was the onely man who oppoſed the conferment of that Title; which he objected, <hi>Climenes</hi> could not with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour accept: having before the face of his Army diſavowed the acception of any ſuch ſtyle: for otherwiſe the true lineal Regal Race had never been extirpated, nor their memory extinguiſhed. 2. That an Ariſtocratical and no Monarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was intended in all their proceedings; and this ſworn to, if either Fidelity or Oaths could <hi>oblige</hi> them. 3. That he could not ſee but as many of them had been equal ſharers in the hazard; ſo they
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:170382:142"/> might by Law of Arms become equal ſharers in the quality of Honour. Theſe objections were with more boldneſs preſſed, then they could be poſſibly by his weak ſtrength or aſſiſtance ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For though ſometimes his fair uſage and ſtout courage had ſtrongly poſſeſt him of the hearts of the Souldiery, his late retirement and privacy, by his affecting a rural life, had quite eſtranged their endeerments from him, being onely devoted moſt to his ſervice, whereby they had moſt hope of pay: which <hi>Climenes</hi> ſpirit to his great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ever ſtrove to make good; for though his Exchecquer grew lean, being exhauſted by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry unfortunate attempts, purſued to his apparent diſhonour, with the loſs of his eldeſt and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt ſouldiers: yet ſuch was his ambition, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with an avaritious diſpoſition, which had ſprung to that height, as he would digg <hi>Pluto</hi> out of Hell for gold, as exactions and onerous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts, unknown to the State of <hi>Candy,</hi> before his time, returned ever freſh and free ſupplies to the daring Souldier, on whoſe ſhoulders he reer'd the ſtructure of his uſurped honour. Neither did it much trouble him to impair the Subjects ſtate, ſo he might improve the Souldiers ſtrength, whoſe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news were his ſupportance.</p>
               <p>Now, thoſe bold expreſſes of <hi>Lamachus</hi> could not be ſo privately delivered, but they were as ſoon diſcovered. <hi>Climenes</hi> gathered from hence how the game went. This it was which broke the long continued League betwixt <hi>Climenes</hi> and his Chieftain <hi>Lamachus</hi> (for ſo was he wont to call him:) and to expedite his revenge, he adviſeth
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170382:143"/> with his Councel, depraved and active enough to put on his deſign, though his own vindicative ſpirit needed no ſuch fiery Inſtruments, how and in what manner he might requite his kindneſs; which his incenſed thoughts prompt him to anſwer with all violence, as appeared afterwards by ſundry particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of high conſequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Climenes</hi> could not be readier to propoſe, then theſe vicious Councellors were to ſuggeſt: It was revenge which he purſued, and they to time it, were as apt to excite him to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> ſaying pleaſed theſe corrupters of Juſtice better then the impartial cenſure of that juſt Father, who being requeſted to bear himſelf indifferently in his cenſure, anſwered, <hi>Be it farre from me not to pleaſure my friends in all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This fire burſt out into that violent and impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heat, as his firſt deſign was, to clip <hi>Lamachus</hi> wings by abridging his power; which he execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to purpoſe, by taking from him the Command which he had given him in reward of his hazardous ſervice over the <hi>Epirian</hi> Horſe, a great addition to his ſtrength and annual revenues, which diſhonour ſo highly trenching upon <hi>Lamachus,</hi> this ſubtile <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, Climenes</hi> pretended to be the Act of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and not of his, which he was pleaſed to ſignifie upon every occaſion; never meeting <hi>Lamachus</hi> without a diſſembling hugge, and a treacherous imbrace. Neither could he, for all his ſubtilty, ſo palliate the inward hate he bore him, but even in Table-diſcourſe he would make <hi>Lamachus</hi> uſually the ſubject of his Story; inquiring how he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in his Country life, and what imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

And for his Summer Progreſſes, they were accompanied with ſuch fears &amp; jealouſies, as every Buſh repreſented to his feavouriſh thoughts a Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear. Thus were his Recreations made his Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;

Whereof one of that prime Houſe ſo highly prized himſelf in his late acquired purchaſe of Honour, as he ſtick'd not to vie with the chiefeſt of the Peerage, yet was his extraction well known to all the City, being found in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy laid ſwathled in a Church-yard, left wholly to the care and proviſion of the Pariſh.

The ſecond was, That he would render an account of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of all thoſe vaſt ſums, by which the State had been ſo impoveriſhed, and the Royall Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer exhauſted: Whereto <hi>Climenes</hi> with an haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and imperious deport, without any civility at all ſhown to thoſe Counſellors of State, replyed; That they were in a great error, if they expected to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Tranſcript from his hand of any Speech that he had delivered, for it had never been his uſe, either to imploy his own Pen, nor any other <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> in order to his Expreſſes, but that it was a divine Providence inſpiring him, whereon he relyed, and the only Directory by which he regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſubject of his Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>And in anſwer to their ſecond requeſt, as their expectance of an Account from him, diſcovered in them an unexemplary boldneſs, ſo would his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence to their demand in that particular argue his weakneſs; with which irreſolute anſwer they returned leſſe ſatisfied, but more exaſperated then before.</p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:170382:146"/>
               <p>But little cared <hi>Climenes</hi> for their incenſement, his hand was upon his Sword, as <hi>Tideus</hi> layd his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Shield; his higheſt deſign was, his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers pay, which procured, he hoped ere long to pay them home who oppoſed him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Climenes</hi> had read, no doubt, that Story of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> and knew well how to make ſingular uſe of it. Of whom it was obſerved,<note place="margin">Strabo, Suidas, Stobaeus, Dion.

The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of ſo eminent an example, probably induced him to give command, that ſundry parties of Horſe, in good number, ſhould march to and fro cloſe by the Senate gate with light matches, purpoſely to beget a Feaver in the Houſe, and conſequently in all their Votes to correſpond with his deſires and dangerous deſigns.</p>
               <p>And ſome of theſe feaveriſh ſpirits, like wiſe Politicians, were carried away with ſuch imaginary fears of death, which they underſtood to be in the power of the Sword; and that it argued ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to enter into diſpute with force and fury, as they cunningly acted the part of <hi>Metius Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>

Others there were of more fiery ſpirits, who ſpake home, and were as homely reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:170382:146"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellonius</hi> to his advantage was not addmitted to be a Member of the Synod; and if he had, it was generall thought, his preſence had been to ſmall purpoſe; for though a profeſt enemy to <hi>Climenes</hi> proceedings, yet he was ever held a Perſon of more abilities for a pitcht Field, then a Council of State.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>Lamachus,</hi> though much was expected, he had learn'd ſo much Councel of <hi>Harpocrates,</hi> as to lay his finger on his mouth, and teach his tongue to keep ſilence.</p>
               <p>Of all this great Aſſembly, there appeared very few to acquieſce to <hi>Climenes</hi> ſupplies, though the occaſions and neceſſities of the Kingdom were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently preſſed, and that the conſtitution of the State could no way ſubſiſt without them. Neither could it avail him to bend his Bow, wanting ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news and ſtrings to expedite his ſhot.</p>
               <p>Highly incenſed was <hi>Climenes</hi> with this unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected reſult from the Aſſembly, but principally from the City; wherein, though there were many Indian Merchants, who, as he ſuppoſed, had fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered their Neſts ſufficiently, yet would they find no Supplies to accommodate his urgent neceſſity, which appeared not only in his publick imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and conſtant disburſements, in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of a ſtanding Army, and a ſtraying Navy, but likewiſe in relation to his private ingagements, by marrying his Daughters to eminent Perſons, with fair promiſes, but ſlow performance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Climenes</hi> having taken notice of the diſaffection of ſuch, on whom he had relyed, with the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent power and increaſing ſtrength of thoſe, by
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:170382:147"/> whom he ſtood oppoſed; ſo as it appeared wholly improbable to him, how any expediences ſhould be for his accomodation procured, or ought condeſcended to as he deſired, without more ado: As one tranſported with an implacable paſſion, not without ſome menaces of revenge, he entred the Senate Houſe, and with a rough furrowed counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, diſſolv'd that great Councel; determining all thoſe weighty Reſolves and Reſults of the Pretorian in one peremptory period; concluding, that the late diſorders of that Aſſembly, had begot more diſtractions in the State of <hi>Candy,</hi> then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years before, during all their civil Warrs, had ever produced; and that thoſe domeſtick diviſions fomented in the breaſt of a factious Houſe, would breath a freſh vein to the effuſion of more new bloud then the late civil Warrs, by their fatal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to the irreparable ruine of that State, had formerly occaſioned: This ſtorm, ſaid he, with a countenance no leſſe ſtormy, appears yet in a cloud, but it would ſhortly break forth into a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tempeſt, which the misfortunes of a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered State might more eaſily bemoan then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; incounter then divert.</p>
               <p>It was the opinion of ſome judicious Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that the diſſolving of this Grand Councel redounded highly to <hi>Climenes</hi> diſadvantage; for if his paſſion would have given way to reaſon, it was verily thought, that the Senate would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced to his Demands.</p>
               <p>But truth is, it was high time for <hi>Climenes</hi> to provide for his own ſafety, being ſo dangerouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, that if he had not ſeaſonably diſſolv'd this
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170382:147"/> Great Council, it would in few dayes have taken courſe to diſſolve him, by forcing him to act his laſt Scene on the Scaffold, as he had done to many others, and to ſubmit his head to <hi>Bonnardus</hi> Hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, by paying his life tribute to the funeral Obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies of a fatal Mortality; for his many inſolencies, heavy impoſitions, and inſucceſſive adventures, had quite razed out the memory of his former Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and reſolv'd his imperious height into mortal hate.</p>
               <p>Neither did his words only but his actions give his Adverſaries, occaſion to fear the heat of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for the whole Baſtile Royal became ſtored with his diſ-affected Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>There was none, to his apprehenſion, that bare him or his Adherents the leaſt hate, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged not with ſemblable ſpite.</p>
               <p>Neither was his fury thus bounded, for remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring thoſe undigeſted affronts and indignities which he had received from the City, he deviſed how to lay heavy burdens upon the Citizens, not only in relation to their trading or commerce, which by Pyracies, and other Marine Occurrents, became obſtructed, but even to their buildings, which to the improvement of his own Coffers, or the advance of his Souldiers, were highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced.</p>
               <p>Neither was the City ſlow in requiting theſe diſcurteſies, whereof as they were very ſenſible; ſo in theſe times of their ſufferings there was an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offered them for acting what their thoughts had privately deſigned.</p>
               <p>About this time there chanced to ariſe a great
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170382:148"/> difference betwixt two eminent Families within the City, the <hi>Cerviſiarii</hi> and <hi>Diſpenſatorii.</hi> Now <hi>Climenes</hi> ſtood wholly for the former, but the City, in oppoſition of him, for the latter; ſo as there fell no place nor office of command within the walls, wherein the <hi>Disp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nſatorii</hi> upon election were not preferred, and the <hi>Cerviſiarii</hi> rejected. This nettled <hi>Climenes</hi> heart above all others, being ſo nearly concerned in his Relations to the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Cerviſiarii,</hi> as he ever ingenuouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged even in the height of his fortunes, that his Extraction originally received breath from that Family. But this diſguſt, were it never ſo juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded (as indeed they could not wound them, but it muſt paſſe through his ſides) thoſe that were the prime Commoners, holding the greateſt ſtroak and ſway in the City, ſlighted his threats, and diſeſteem'd his frowns: For though he ruled all by the power of the Sword, yet they knew how to oppoſe him by the ſtrength of their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the priviledges whereof he had conſtantly proteſted to maintain, even unto death. Now the expreſs words of their antient Charter, continued by many Centuries of years, in the Ordination of all Civil Offices, admitted a free Election, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ever thoſe three fearful Precipices, Fear, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Reward.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, ſo inveterate was the Plebeian hate to <hi>Climenes,</hi> as his Lady <hi>Adipa,</hi> (a meer ſtranger to a Princely poſture) could never make her viſits in the City, but the refuſe and off-ſcum of thoſe ſtreets, where ſhe occaſionally paſſed, would not ſtick publickly to revile her, aſperſing the fowleſt
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170382:148"/> terms of infamy and diſgrace upon her; yet when inquiry was made, the Authors could not be found. So hard it is to return a remedy, where Authority inclines to a partial connivence; cordially intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whatſoever is pretended, to give way, be it never ſo much purſued, for the Offenders impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>Howſoever this ancient uncivilized Lad ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as great a Stranger to <hi>Climenes</hi> crimes, as ſhe was in her own perſon to all courtly State, moulding her ſelf neerer to her own rural Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the majeſty of that ſuperlative condition, whereto ſhe was ſo lately advanced; and indeed, neither was her Perſon nor Breeding ſutable for courting.</p>
               <p>By this time, <hi>Climenes</hi> growing jealous of the affection of his Souldiery, who ſeemed much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with the unexpected diſſolution of the Senate, convened before him all the Major-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and prime Officers of his Army, to whom; drawing aſide the hangings of his lodging-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he communicated his troubled thoughts in this manner:</p>

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:170382:149"/> us: The Champaign accommodated our Army with all conveniencies ſutable for our underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings: All the Elements fought for us, to make our Atchievements more glorious, our continued Victories more numerous. Neither ſhall I bluſh, from a grateful recollection of my own conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to acknowledge the Providence of Heaven, in raiſing me from a low ground to this gradual aſcent, whereto by ſtep and ſtep I have mounted; Gradually I may properly ſay; for without aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing any thing to my ſelf, I ſhall ingenuouſly confeſs it, that in my firſt initiation and exerciſe of Armes, I was as one of you, nay lower in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count then the loweſt of you; and by what ſtaires did I aſcend to this height, or by whoſe hands was I lifted up to this Seat? I call the Heavens to record, in whoſe preſence I ſtand, that it was not my ambition, but your unanimity and free Election, which farre above my thoughts, or hopes, raiſed me to this condition. It was your joynt voice and vote that layd upon me theſe Commands; they were put upon me, and not ſought. And muſt my actions now be queſtioned, that have been ever caſt in that mould, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with no other end then preſervation of the Subjects ancient Liberties, Royal Priviledges, the life of the Laws, the juſt maintenance of our Honour, with the ſafety of our Perſon, the ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty whereof I have many times neglected, as your ſelves well know, for advancement of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick? Now reſolve me, will it become you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain jealous thoughts touching your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, whoſe higheſt endeavours have been

If you have a love for me, retain it, it ſhall be my aim to deſerye it; if otherwiſe, diſcover it. Lay down your Commiſſions, whoſoever you be, that have no mind to ſerve me. Upon my reputation I vow it, your diſ-ſervice, and deſertion of me, ſhall not diſtaſte me: Nay, if you ſhould imbody your ſelves in an Army, I could do no leſſe then ſmile at your folly, and cheerfully imbattle you, and make your own blood ſatisfactory for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. Neither do I ſpeak this to incenſe them, whoſe impoyſoned thoughts harbour ſome jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous opinions concerning me; but to declare to the world how lightly I weigh them, who vapour forth their undigeſted, griefs without grounds, deſiring nothing more then to imbroile the State, and involve our late reduced Nation in a new Warre. I ſhall only tell theſe diſaffected Ones, that I ſhould rather have chuſed to keep Sheep on an hill, then born Command over ſuch Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries, whoſe deſigns ſecretly act for ſhedding more innocent bloud, then all their Sympathetick powders have power to ſtanch. As for thoſe that will be intirely mine, they ſhall have that intereſt in me, and influence over me, that though I be their Commander, they ſhall be Commanders of my affection, and receive ample remonſtrances of their alacrious ſervice and fidelity towards me.</q>

               <p>This Speech wrought attention on ſome with applauſe, which was manifeſted by their Hum; but the diſcontented Party went away unſatisfied as they came. Which <hi>Climenes</hi> quickly obſerving, reſolved to take another courſe, and in ſuch a way as might accommodate him in three main reſpects, both for ſecuring his Perſon, ſtrengthening his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and raiſing him to the higheſt pitch of his Ambition.</p>

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170382:152"/> it worthy taking up, if it lay in the ſtreet. But this care is exacted of me, and I muſt become a principal ſharer in it: this yoak is impoſed on me, and I muſt bear it.</q>

               <p>His Cabinet Counſel was ſo fitly moulded to his bent, as they knew well how to ſooth his humour. So as, though ſome of them had highly diſguſted <hi>Climenes</hi> raſh Act of diſſolving the Synod without the privity or approvement of his Councel; they not only with joynt vote aſſented, but ſtrongly importuned him to expedite his Reſolve in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the Imperial Crown. This was the Lure which they applied, and whereon his attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive appetite quickly baited. Neither did <hi>Climenes</hi> retard their deſires: For though dayly ſwounings ariſing from an ill-limited ſwinge of paſſion, and fury of oppoſition had much enfeebled him: nay, though nightly fears and jealouſies, uſher'd in with terrible viſions had greiviouſly ſtartled him; yet ſo ſtrongly had Ambition ſeiz'd upon his thoughts, as nothing could be with more winged
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:170382:152"/> ſpeed accelerated, then the purſuit of his Imperial Inveſtiture; which within few dayes after, was with more privacy then publick ſolemnity accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in this manner.</p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>Ferrara</hi> by his <hi>Proxie</hi> was highly courted to be there preſent, but affairs of more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging concern had ingaged him. The Dukes too of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Millain</hi> were expected;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Climenes</hi> was a Perſon incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, and of a vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which brought him to pay his debt to Nature the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> but upon a Provincial Diet being otherwiſe imployed, they excus'd their abſence. And well might Forraign States be diſpenced with, when the ancient Peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Candie</hi> were taken with ſuch an Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal diſtemper, as none of all theſe could be ſeen at this great Solemnity, conceiving, as might be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected probably, that ſuch an immerited honour was unfittingly conferred on a pretended Power, ſhadowed with the Robe of an uſurped Majeſty; which <hi>Climenes</hi> quickly obſerving, he in great cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler paſſionately vowed, that he verily thought all the Nobility of that Iſland was taken with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenture, but he would find a way to cure their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>
               <p>All this fore-ſlowed not his deſign:<note place="margin">For his jealouſie had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many of his <hi>Life-guard</hi> to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</note> All hands were imployed; all things with much ſtate and magnificence prepared, though the Confluence appeared thin to accompany it. The Imperial <hi>Ebor</hi> or Chair of State was erected: An Arch-Flamin, by whom theſe Regal Ceremonies were to be performed, readily attended: An Imperial Diadem adorned with the pretiouſt Stones that the Eaſt afforded. Where <hi>Climenes,</hi> as if he had put on a new face, anſwerable to the perſon w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he was to repreſent, aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to his Throne with an unwonted
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170382:153"/> ſtate, upon the Corniſh whereof he found theſe words written in a little Scedule: <hi>In terram, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dema ſi tollas, a terra in terram tolleris, antequam geres. On earth, if thou takeſt a Crown, thou mayſt receive it, but from earth thou ſhalt return to earth before thou wear it.</hi> This upon his firſt reading of it did not a little amaze him; but afterwards hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be the device of ſome diſ-affected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or rather ſome Magical Spell or Inchantment, he wholly ſlighted it; though ſhortly after this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation prov'd a true divination. For ſcarcely had that Imperial Crown impaled his head, till (as if it held it ſelf too worthy a Receit for ſuch a Gueſt) he ſunk down ſuddenly, and ſo expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>The report of this unexpected change was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently bruted abroad through all the Garriſons, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the guard of his Perſon, and ſafeguard of the Pallace, which were numerous, and in ſeveral places diſpoſed; ſo many were the fears, jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and affrights, which uſually encountred him; being, indeed to the judgement of all thoſe who knew him, a conſtant terror, or rather a priſon to himſelf; wherein he exerciſed his imperious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and Syracuſan Tyranny, till this adventiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fate (which occaſioned more grounds of joy then tears) cut him off from acting more cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by impoſing a period to his uſurped Power, and cloſing it with a tragick and diſconſolate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe.</p>
               <p>Neither had this report of his death only poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt the Guards, for by this time it had ſounded loudly in the ear of the Roman Regiment, who
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170382:153"/> were ever held the ſtrength and ſinews of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Theſe, as they were Souldiers of Fortune, no ſooner heard of <hi>Climenes</hi> fall, then they ſtood up for anothers riſe. And the late unfortunate and proſcribed <hi>Charicles</hi> muſt be the man;<note place="margin">Charicles <hi>priuſquam</hi> Regale Solium <hi>aſcenderat mortem obiit, a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus diſceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu, illius frater</hi> Jagonius, <hi>Princeps egregiae indolis, ex miae mentis, invicti Spiritus, infatigabilis induſtriae, militibus perquam charus, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni omnium arbitrio,</hi> Imperiali Titulo <hi>cenſebatur digniſſimus.</hi> Ficin. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>parag.</hi> 7.

               </p>
               <p>This ſtartled the Counſel of State; but holding it no diſcretion to diſpute with Power, after a ſhort Conſult (for the heady Regiment would permit no long debate) it was by joynt vote concluded, and with the Signal Manual of the Senate conſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that a Commiſſion General ſo ſealed ſhould be recommended to the care and tranſaction of an Eminent Perſon for that purpoſe elected and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, with qualified Hoſtages depoſited: the purport of which Inſtrument bore this face; That it was the univerſal conſent and deſire of the State of <hi>Candie,</hi> that <hi>Charicles</hi> ſhould be recalled from Baniſhment, and re-inveſted in his hereditary Rights, and Imperial Throne; That Security was already given, by conſiderable Hoſtages, for his
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170382:154"/> ſafe arrival and acceſs to his Metropolitan City <hi>Thamipolis,</hi> and his Royal Pallace <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coma,</hi> a too accurate Seat for an uſurping State.</p>
               <p>Theſe pleaſant tidings came no leſs unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly then ſeaſonably to the ear of <hi>Charicles,</hi> being at that time divided betwixt hope and fear; but over-ballanced were his hopes with feares, having ſuch weak Forces viſibly appearing to advance his hopes.</p>
               <p>Time would admit no delay in purſuit of ſo fair an opportunity; ſo ſoon therefore as he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf with conveniencies ſutable for ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant an Expedition, he reſolved to take his leave of the Court of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and addreſs his courſe for <hi>Candy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many dayes were not paſt, till all things were provided according to his deſires, and every way correſponding with his occaſions.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This relation <hi>Irina</hi> plenteouſly imbathed in tears; but high and conſequent affairs injoyn'd their divertiſement from a purſuit of paſſion, to ſuch a compoſure or moderation, as might ſuit better with the neceſſity of their addreſſes.</p>
               <p>The very next day after <hi>Charicles</hi> repaire to <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coma,</hi> his inauguration was with all Princely mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and ſolemnity performed; wherein it was a wonderful thing to obſerve, with what promptneſs (to omit the incomparable care and ſedulity of his Courtiers) that Neutral City, which ſo lately before had diſ-obliged their abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Soveraign, by impoveriſhing themſelves to ſtrengthen the ſinews of an Uſurper; with what alacrity, I ſay, theſe Protean Proſelytes or State-Chamelions, having changed their hearts as well
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170382:155"/> as habits, manifeſted their Zeal to this late inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd Prince, not only in acclamations, publick ſhows, preſentments, and Bone-fires, with Conduits running freely with all ſorts of Wines, but in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and rich preſents; implying demonſtrative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that though their Treaſuries had been long time ſhut from the ſeizure of an Uſurper, they could readily find keyes to open them to their Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Prince and lineal Emperour.</p>
               <p>This incomparably ingratiated him, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged them in the confirming their Charter, which by their miſcarriage had run it ſelf upon a ſhelf of irreparable danger, had not the Princes indulency paſt over the highneſs of their delinquency: which in the judgment of that time appeared to be a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular argument of clemency in <hi>Charicles,</hi> who had far greater cauſe to revenge then remit, not only the private deſigns, but publick attempts of many ſelf-intereſted Citizens of <hi>Thamipolis,</hi> who profeſt themſelves conſtant Favorites to <hi>Climenes,</hi> during the purſuit of all thoſe Civil Wars; which affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate adherency they were ever ready to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in their ample and voluntary contributions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions, as likewiſe in their promptneſs of Recruits, affording freſh ſupplies to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels aſſiſtance with more quickneſs then it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>Yet the memory of all theſe inſupportable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries by the Princes piety became buried; ſo highly was he taken with thoſe viſible teſtimonies of their ſubmiſſion and humble deſires of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, as his benign diſpoſition made revenge a a ſtranger to his thoughts, receiving them into his
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:170382:155"/> Favour, whoſe actions had merited the heavieſt weight of his diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>Truth is, it was not poſſible that any occaſional diſguſt could be ſo implacable, as not to be in ſome meaſure attempered or mollified by their ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble application, and free agnition of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allegiance towards him, and by what perſon princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally thoſe diſrepects had been fomented: And this was one <hi>Salino,</hi> who had been the only diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinary Martialiſt for the City. A man ſeemingly appearing of a clear and ſerene temper, but cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally factious, and of a turbulent nature; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aggravated by ſundry inſtances, brought him to a ſhorter period then his Complices deſired, though nothing ſooner then his actions deſerved; being executed on the Artillery Round, where his perfidious Head-piece had moulded the platforms of many dangerous diviſions: So eaſie it was for one contagious Member to infect a whole Society, and by poyſonous ingredients diſtemper the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of a Loyally-affected City. For had not the ſiniſter influence of ſuch as theſe operated ſtrongly upon the principles of <hi>Thamipolis,</hi> it had never fallen into ſuch dangerous concluſions, nor profeſt it ſelf either hoſtile or neutral to a lineal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty.</p>
               <p>After this unexpected juncture by the Prince his gratious acceptance of the Citizens into his favour and protection, there paſt not one day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Preſentment or other ſet forth to the beſt beauty and advantage that either Art or Invention could deviſe. Amongſt which there was one only Satyrical Conceit, which took infinitely above the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170382:156"/> reſt; and this was preſented in a dance of Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans, wherein the chiefeſt Sylvan, attired in Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly habit, after the end of the Antick, bearing the vivid Effigies, both in countenance and perſonage, of <hi>Climenes,</hi> ſat mounted in a Chair of State, to whom was preſented a Coronet of pure gold; and having his head ready to be impaled with it, there appeared an hand out of a Cloud ſnatching at the Coronet ſo preſented, and in a Chryſtal Ovally form'd, containing this Impreſſe, DETUR DIG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIORI. This was no ſooner ſhown, then the Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van was with much diſgrace forc'd out of that Chair, wherein he was formerly placed, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more Princely or Majeſtick Sylvan, holding a neer reſemblance both in favour and feature to <hi>Charicles,</hi> was ſet in that Chair of State, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Coronet. This Invention infinitely contented the well-affected, which was generally ſo, or pretending to be ſo. Though <hi>Charicles</hi> forth of a native modeſty, either ſeem'd not to obſerve it, or would take no cogniſance of it, being much below his ſcorn to impe his wings with ſcattered feathers, or to triumph in the diſhonour of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Foe, whoſe ignominy, though it deſerv'd no pity, yet he held it ignoble to rub over the wounds of a blaſted memory.</p>
               <p>Neither did this his gallant compaſſion, extend it ſelf only ſo his deceaſed Enemy, but even to his Poſterity, to as there were none of his Relations, who did not amply taſte of it; only it was his pleaſure with much mildneſs to tax his Daughter <hi>Salacia,</hi> a Lady infinitely ſpritely, and a compleat Curtezan, of her too much liberty, wiſhing her to
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170382:156"/> be more tender of her honour; wherein he expreſt rather the office of a Father then a ſtranger. So as <hi>Alexander,</hi> that univerſal Monarch, could never ſhew more Princely clemency nor affability to <hi>Darius</hi> Wife and his Children, after his Conqueſt, then <hi>Charicles</hi> did to the Relations of <hi>Climenes</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death.</p>
               <p>True it is, that though <hi>Climenes</hi> layd great taxes; aſſeſſes, and impoſitions upon the <hi>Candiots,</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the conſtitution of the State could not otherwiſe ſubſiſt, which preſſures begot him a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Odium amongſt the Natives, whoſe necks had been formerly free of ſuch ſervile yoaks;<note place="margin">Neither, indeed, could <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles,</hi> in reſpect of his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and <hi>Climenes</hi> numerous oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the cenſure of in juſtice, if he had converted his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies rich Coffers to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of his poor Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</note> yet theſe allegations of his appear'd to be, after his death, meer pretences; for his Coffers were full of treaſure, beſides the Banks he had ſtored up in other Nations; which by report of ſome Merchants im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in thoſe parts, and neerly intereſted in his Commands, were of high conſequence.</p>
               <p>Now collect hence the rare temperance and moderation of <hi>Charicles</hi> amidſt theſe attractive Baits. Power enough he had to ſeize on them, and to convert them to his own Treaſury; yet neither could the memory of an Enemy, nor his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtleſs Authority, induce him to act ought that might detract from the ſplendor of Juſtice, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear light in the ſcale of Equity. Whatſoever thoſe, who had relation to <hi>Climenes,</hi> impropriate to themſelves, he not only left untoucht, but publiſh'd it as his expreſs Command, that none, under what colour or pretence ſoever, ſhould ſeize upon any ſuch treaſure, ſubſtance, or utenſils, but leave them to the injoyment of his Succeſſors without diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance:
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170382:157"/> Which Princely compaſſion not only gave wings to his Fame, but won thoſe to his affection, whoſe hearts had been before Aliens to his devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and private obſtructers (for further they durſt not go) to his late inveſtiture and inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But to the end he might declare himſelf in a more ſatisfactory manner to his Peerage and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, he propos'd a ſixt day, wherin he intended to communicate his thoughts and deſigns relating to the State in general; as likewiſe touching ſome eminent Perſons, of whoſe different opinions and affections towards him, he had received both by intelligence, and perſonal intereſts, ample demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, which in a Princely demean and well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming poſture (as none could deliver his mind with a more majeſtick preſence, nor propriety of expreſs) he returned in this ſort.</p>

                           <pb n="300" facs="tcp:170382:158"/>
                           <p>Yet in relation to that Fact, the unexemplary cruelty whereof no Age may parallel, we are not wholly ignorant, how thoſe Aſſacinates (for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we cannot poſſibly brand them) were of a ſeveral and diſtinct qualification in that tragick and tyrannick Scene; ſome being only Aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thoſe traduced by error; others Active, and thoſe poſſeſſed with rankor, whoſe irregular fury deſerves an higher cenſure.</p>
                           <p>For the former, we have a boſom opening to mercy; but for the latter, as they had active hands in depriving their Native Prince of life, and us of a Father; it cannot be otherwiſe holden then a mild ſeverity, and a temperate act of Juſtice, if we abridge their liberty, by confining them to a perpetual reſtraint: Our well-affected Party has been confined for their conſcientious obedience, well may theſe ſuffer in the ſame manner for their diſ-allegiance.</p>
                           <p>As for that prime Moulder and Fomenter of theſe miſchiefs, more exquiſite tortures had been inflicted on him, if his ſudden death had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented our revenge.</p>
                           <p>Others there be, who, though our too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy and bounty oblig'd them to us, yet were they made Intelligencers againſt us. No paſſage in our Cabinet-Counſel, were it never ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, could promiſe ſecreſie, nor to our Perſon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, through their intereſts and intercourſe of Letters with our mortal Enemy: Some of theſe State-timiſts we have formerly diſcovered, and laid it open unto them, ſhadowing their excuſe with ſilence; for no other defence could they
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170382:158"/> pretend for their diſ-ſervice; only ſome formal arguments of remorſe were afterwards ſhown by them which allay'd our heat, injoyning them no other pennance then their abſence for our ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Our Reſolves ſtand fixt; they muſt hold themſelves ſtrangers to our Court. Fruits being once corrupted at heart, appear they never ſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, cannot prove ſound.</p>
                           <p>For you, my Commons, we impute your neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of obedience to that common error of Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian ignorance; we are confident that your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty clos'd in that low degree, as it ſcarcely deſerv'd to fall under the notion of Treaſon; you were carried along with the ſtrong current of the time; applying your weak intereſts to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory commands of your Superiours. It was your ſole deſire to ſit quietly under your own Vine, and to partake of the fruit of your own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives; whereof, by this injoyment of peace, you may amply receive the benefit.</p>
                           <p>Rely on the reputation of his word, under whoſe Soveraignty you live, that you cannot be more dear to your ſelves then you ſhall be unto us, ſo popular Faction divide you not from us. Not do we doubt it, for we ſee that cheerfulneſs in your faces, as it aſſures us, that nothing but Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of loyalty can be writ in your hearts: From which aſſurance, we have ſigned your pardon with the Signet Manual of our pity.</p>
                           <p>Now for you the Citizens of our great <hi>Thami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> we cannot be ignorant of your free contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions to our diſadvantage, your purſes were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtraitened, nor your hands contracted, ſo you
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170382:159"/> might by the emptying of your Coffers ſtrengthen the ſinews of the publick Enemy, in the defiance of your Princes ſoveraignty. Notwithſtanding all this, you ſhall know that our reſolves are ſteered rather by Reaſon then Paſſion; and that the reliſh of Remorſe has ſtronger influence over us then the ſpirit of revenge: nay, that it ſhall be ever the loweſt of our ſcorn, to lift up our hand to ſtrike, where Princely Clemency invites us to ſpare; nor to uſe Corraſives, where we hope that Cordials may cure; we appear here in this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian, where we have been lately re-inveſted in our lineal right, ready to receive you with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent boſom, and lodge you in the armes of mercy. In a word, our compaſſion ſhall acquaint you, that as our feet be ſlow in attempting, ſo we are none of thoſe <hi>Syracuſan</hi> Furies, whoſe hands were heavy in inflicting. And to cement your hearts more individually to us, our requeſt ſhall be this unto you all, that you would uſe your Swords for us, ſo long as we govern juſtly, and to unſheath them againſt us, when we act ought deviouſly, or contrary to the rule of Equity.</p>
                           <p>Mean time we give way, that your Charter, Liberties, Priviledges, and Immunities be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in as large and ample manner, to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes, as they were firſt granted; for it is not our meaning, that you ſhould loſe any thing by your late oppoſition, ſo you redeem the time, and repair your fame by ſubſequent Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of your loyalty and affection.</p>
